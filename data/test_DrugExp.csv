2|3|ADHD i am going crazy i dont sleep and if i do i am thrown into terriable horrifying nightmares that i only wake up from by screaming myself awake i hate being around people i have shut everyone out of my life because im afraid of how they will affect my plans and my future always observant but this causes aniexty i dont eat ever maybe one time a week they say it will take me a year to get back to normal but i cant even remember what normal for me is plz stay away from this drug it only brings depression hullisionations thoughts of sucicide and anger nan
3|4|treatment resistant depression none i ll admit i was terrified to get the prescription fill it and then take the pills but after fighting depression so hard for almost 6 years now and being unable to tolerate ssri drugs i had to take that chance and accept the help i feel fine the first day a bit energetic just wanted to thank all for your posts it helped a lot in my research and to some please be a little less harsh on people who choose this med they may not want to get high they may be just like me who just would give anything to feel better for a bit and get their lives on track
4|5|Because I felt like it my heartbeat was a little irregular but nothing scary i didn t really want to eat i was very thirsty and had a bad taste in my mouth i became quite ocd and felt like i had to organize everything i took adderall at school because i was depressed and i heard from a friend that it would help no it wasn t prescribed to me and i took 40 mg which probably wasn t the best idea i would take only 20 maybe although at first my hands were a little shaky and i had some ocd tendencies i paid very very close attention in math class and was able to answer many problems that i usually never can also i was in a great mood for the rest of the day don t abuse this pill but i d be lying if i said i didn t like it
5|6|extreme vertigo EXTREME fatigue, couldn't even FORCE my eyes open. Fell asleep in the tub. My eyes kepg rolling and going cross. Felt like I was in a complete fog and I couldn't even think straight. The Dr. gave me this med in the ER. I asked if it would make me feel funny (I do not like taking meds but I was so tired of the dizziness that I was willing to try it) and he said no. I drove home 2 hours after being given the Antivert and as I was driving, I was literally scared. I couldn't focus, couldn't concentrate and was afraid I was going to have to pull over. I made it home safely. After a few hours of not being able to shake the feeling, I decided to take a bath. Thankfully my cat likes to sit on the side of my tub while I bathe because I think she saved my life. I dozed off at least 4 times and every time I was awaken by my cat patting my arm. I probably would have drownd and not even cared. Dangerous drug, if you ask me!
6|7|Vertigo Tiredness I was just diagnosed with vertigo and I took Antivert for the first time this week. The vertigo seemed to go away, but at the cost of being very tired for about 24 hours.
7|8|mild dementia My 81 year old mother, who I really love, is always up at 8 a.m. to eat her cereal and watch TV, every morning, and she goes on walks up the street several times per day. She was prescribed Aricept 10 mg. and took her first dose at 7:45 p.m. on 1/1/2011. Since Sunday morning she has been having very severe side effects. Labored breathing, loose bowels--not stool, profuse sweating, and she has been so tired she cannot open her eyes for more than a couple of seconds. She had the pill at 7:45 pm on Saturday January 1 before bed and now she is still sleeping and sweating profusely and cannot walk. I can tell she is dreaming as she is talking in her sleep and reaching for something. Other side effects slurred speech, disoriented as to where she is, and what she should do next. This drug is VERY VERY strong and I would recommend to never give an 81 year old 10 mg dose initially. Wish my mom luck to wake up soon please.
8|9|hives, mild anxiety made me drowsy but i took it at nite but i slept well and longer than usual around 9 10 hrs i did have a nightmare that nite maybe a coincidence after a first time bout of hives lasting on and off for about 7 weeks and finding only minimal relief from benadryl oatmeal baths calamine etc i got a prescription for 10 mg of atarax i took it once and slept through the night without staying awake from intense itching the next morning i felt a touch groggy but so grateful to not have any itching i did not take another dose because there was no renewed itching and the size of the existing hives on my body was starting to shrink i did not get any new hives after this first dose am keeping my fingers crossed it has been almost 72 hrs since that dose and i have not needed to take it again
9|10|Uti Bodywide Burning skin, lips, and mouth. Sore throat. Back and chest pain. Brain fog. Nausea. Dizziness. All this after just one dose! Apparently I am allergic, like so many others, to sulfa based drugs. I wound up in the ER having to get a high dosage of steroids and Benadryl along with a 3 day prescription to counteract the reaction. I'm just now starting to feel alive again.
10|11|Severe Diarrhea Today I took the first two doses of Bactrim DS Generic and this stuff already sucks pretty bad! My arms feel like they are vibrating I am trembling so much. Also I feel anxious to the point that I'll fall asleep briefly then jump awake for no reason feeling scared. If there is anybody out there that has had similar effects and gotten through some or all of them please post that on this web site or email me as I'm sure myself and many others would like to know about how long we can expect to feel this bad. I promise I will post updates to my progress as time goes on. I hope that I just have to wait for this drugs half life to pass a few time to feel normal again. The half life is 10 hours. God bless anyone else who is suffering. You will be in my prayers.
11|12|UTI Fever, muscle and joint pain, fatigue Symptoms resolved immediately when medication stopped
12|13|ER visit SEVERE blurred vision, dizziness, very dry mouth, drowsiness, chills. I was sent to the ER due to bad stomach pains. The doctor gave me Bentyl because he thought it was due to IBS. 5 minutes after taking it I could not even read the text on my cell phone my vision was so blurred. The blurriness lasted around 15 minutes. It was very uncomfortable. The dizziness was horrible too. I remember having a hard time walking to the bathroom. My mouth became so dry that they had to put me on a IV to pump more fluids in me. Just be careful if you have to take this stuff.
13|14|Osteoporsis Within 1 hour I had piercing head pain which increased with movement. Took my blood pressure and it was 152/103. At my physician's office 9 days earlier it was 118/78. I am an athlete who does triathlons and in training for my first ironman. I immediately went to the doctor and she had to put me on blood pressure medication. Day 2 wasn't much better. Day 3 was fairly good with the blood pressure under control and minor headache. Continued with my training for the ironman which is on September 27. Day 4 woke up with the severe headache and my diastolic pressure (the lower number over 100). The jabbing head pain nearly caused a fall. By 4pm I started with excruciating stomach pain. So right now I'm in bed in agony. I hope this Boniva doesn't cause me not to achieve my goal Be very careful about taking boniva
14|15|had some bone loss in hip Well, it wasn't boniva it was actonol but I know these are basically the same and I want to go on record in as many forums. So... I took the one pill at 7 am. By 10 pm, my hands and feet felt like blocks of ice. My stomach started aching. I took a bath but couldn't warm up. By 10;30 I began vomiting and it lasted uptil 6 in the morning. I'd throw up, then sort of pass out, then wake up and relive it all over again. I became so very close to calling 911 but couldn't even stand to pick up phone and talk. The next day I was on the couch all day. The next two days, every time I got up, I had diarreah. I had to take sick days at work things were so bad. Finally it's been a week and I feel about 80% back to myself. But I will NEVER take this type of drug again. Going to do my own research and work on this without these drugs. When the cure is worse than the disease, there's a problem.
15|16|osteo severe low back pain hip pain shoukder pain and elbow and hand pain I wont take it again
16|17|To get rid of frown lines btw. eyes soreness from injection site this is about the 4th time i ve received botox it has worked wonders to diminish the frown lines elevens between my eyes it was 240 for 20 units but it wears off eventually if it were free i d go back every three months instead i ve been going about every 9 months
17|18|High Blood Pressure Very weak, gi distress, involuntary muscle movement. I only took 1 dose &amp; this med really messed me up for a week now. Every time I eatI feel bad. I have acute IBS and am very sensrtive to meds. Explained this to dr before being prescribed,he didnt seemed concerned Trying to get back to normal. Muscle jerking subsided after a couple of days after not taking it. DON'T TTAKE THIS DRUG!
18|19|swimmer's ear EXTREME nausea within a few minutes of taking. I took one dose of this medicine 13 years ago, and my life has NEVER been the same! I have suffered from nausea ever since. I have even had to go to a university medical center, where they blame this medicine for disrupting my stomach. Cefzil has forever changed my life. Please, NEVER take this medicine!
19|20|"ED Upper and lower back pain, thigh and calf pain Took it once Wed night about 6:30pm. w/wife in bed for an hour talking, flirting, touching, never really got hard hard until we started serious foreplay. Went soft before I even got around to ""it"" about 9pm. Friday morning woke with severe back pain across upper and lower, from side to side. Also, leg cramps from thighs to calves. Now Sunday 11pm and still painful legs, back not so much. Taking restless leg homeopathy and ibuprofen just to sleep a couple hours. Planning trip to dr or hosp but found this and other site that confirms Cialis as cause. http://www.goodinbed.com/discuss/2011/06/crazy-bad-pain-taking-cialis/"
20|21|Mild ED The flushing was evident an hour after intake, what bothered me was the leg calf cramps 12 hours after taking the pill.. It was intense, then a day after my buttocks area was sore. Had some bouts of heartburn too.. I would pick viagra anytime than this unless you plan on doin it multiple times in 36 hours.. Not worth the risk in my opinion.
21|22|ED Started out fine ... Then I had leg..butt...all over pain the next morning ...migraine headache into 3rd day .. irritable...very fatigued... Won't take it again ... Wont take it again...

29|30|Spinal fluid leak headache i was jumping out of my skin shaky felt i was going to die had no control can t believe i am not the only one that had the jumping out of my skin reaction after put in iv after that horrible feeling and reading these comments i think they should not give in iv unless they know if patient has had oral dose and was ok with it they should also have emergency stop plan instead of nurses saying there isn t anything we can do has to work through your body
30|31|Headache, nausea i was given this drug in the er combined with benadryl because of a headache what they thought might be a migraine within minutes of getting the drug i felt so anxious i couldn t stand it i felt like i wanted to scream i felt like i had to move my legs i got up from my bed and kept pacing around the room this was right before getting a spinal tap and holding still for that spinal tap was next to impossible and then i wasn t able to lay down afterwards i was up until 4 am drug given around 9 pm pacing and wanting desperately to just collapse into unconsciousness i managed to sleep a little after taking benadryl but i still feel very jittery and uncomfortable this morning this drug is incredibly dangerous and considering the high possibility for this side effect i think it should come with a warning or possibly be banned entirely
31|32|Migraine at the ER this drug should be black boxed by the fda i went to er with a 3 day long migraine and was given an iv with compazine and benadryl i immediately felt an extreme hot flash down my body from head to toe and then my legs started moving and i started shaking my teeth were chattering i was cold and hot and then felt an this intense anxiety wash over me in a wave that is almost inexpainable and horribly scarey i was convinced i was going to die i can describe it like a contraction you would have during labor it started out slow and then got stronger and stronger and when it was at its peak it was almost unbareable my friend and my husband did their best to talk me through it and tell me i was not going to die the nurse did not have a bp cuff on me and had left the room my friend that was with me and is an emt took my pulse and it was about 170 during the anxiety attack she went to get the nurse who came in and said it was just the benadryl and would go away after she left i had i could bearly sit still on the way home i still was having anxiety attacks and insisted my emt friend keep telling me i wasn t going to die i got home and took 1 0 more mg of xanex that i had previously been given to use for my fear of flying i am 4 days out and still talking 5 mg every 12 hrs or so i am a nervous wreck and feel like i have ptsd it was awful i will never have an iv hooked up again if i can help it i don t think the er is a option for me i would rather die at home than go through that experience again i thought the moto was do no harm guess it is not the moto doctor s use anymore it is more like give whatever and to heck with the side effects damn the patients up with the pharma companies
32|33|Migraine like many of the others i was taken to the er for migraine and given compazine the doctors did tell me about the possible side effects but said they had never seen someone experience them once the iv was done i felt this amazing need to get out of the hospital and have the iv out my husband asked if this could be a side effect and i said no just so they wouldn t give me anything else i was jittery and couldn t stop moving all night fortunately i am able to sleep but i am on day 2 and sitll experiencing symptoms of restlessness and wanting to climb out of my skin though they aren t as bad as yesterday just took a benadryl to try and counteract the symptoms i am praying this will work because i have to fly to chicago later today nan

The only words that could come out of my mouth were, ""I can't think...I can't think...I can't think...etc."" Soon after, my head tried to physically twist around on its own like the Exorcist girl. I had to use my hand to keep my head from twisting. The physical pain in my body, coupled with my brain's near vegetables state was so horrible, I started crying, and punching these sofas to deal with the pain. Some time has passed before psychiatrists came back into the room I was in to give me a ""haldol side effect releaser"", which was an injection. They took me to my bed, told me to sleep, and when I woke up they said I would be better again. I had to sleep on a certain side of my face to keep my head from turning. I went to sleep. When I woke up, the pain was gone. However, I suffered from severe depression about a year later that lasted for two years. Als Never accept this drug. When the psychiatrist first wanted me to take it, I refused. I then decided to take it, thinking I was giving the psychiatrists a hard time. Worst mistake I ever made. Never let anybody give you this drug. I will ruin your life."

103|104|UTI Extreme GI distress I must have had an allergic reaction or oversensitivity to this drug. I had taken in the past with no major issues. Was given as treatment for UTI. Took 1st pill and felt fine, for about 2 hours.. then I felt upper abdominal/reflux-like pain that gradually worsened until I began vomiting almost uncontrollably for about 3 hours.. then, it was weird, I could almost feel the pill moving down my GI tract! I then had severe cramping and shooting pains, along with the accompanying diarrhea. In total, the reaction lasted 6 hours. Being a total dope, I thought this was a fluke.. and the next day I took another pill. Well.. the exact same thing happened. My husband wanted to take me to the ER, as it was so severe, but I rode out the 6 hours again, then all was over. I rated it low because of my personal reaction, which does not seem to be norm, but just wanted to report in case someone else experiences the same thing.

118|119|Resistant pneumonia None as havn't taken it. Got given it because I have a resistant strain of pneumonia(milder form) which was not resistant to start with it happened because I was underdosed a previous antibiotic amoxicillin in only 250mgs I'm 60kgs wtf does docs be at at all. Iv held off taking this medicine as I know I'll get the side effects and there's no guarantee it will work. Although I'm sick of the lung pain n fatigue I'd rather wait for the respiratory specialist appointment. I need ct scan and bronchoscopy at this stage as I can't get up mucus to test it. I'm not trying anything else unless I know it will work. What a nightmare. And have to fight with docs 4 help n waiting on apps while my life is on hold. Joke. Thanks to that person is who put up that l glutathione I think it was helps with this. I ordered it online to supplement in case Iv no choice but to take this. I can't live with this infection in my lung forever so frustrated that a simple moderate infection was easily treatable but I wasn't given enough of a simple antibiotic amoxicillin as if there was drought on or something n bacteria adapted n can fend off all antibiotics. That's why was looking at having to take this now. I'm so sorry to all the ppl that's health have been damaged by this it's very sad indeed. I hope god will give yous healing but I know this doesn't work. I'm being very cautious this time as one year ago flagyl damaged my health by shrinking my right leg - it wasted my leg muscles AND bone yes f*g bone unbelievable. I think it shrunk all my bones abit. I'm undergoing physio for the wasted muscles which are slowly improving n now on calcium supplements for osteopenia which I attribute to the flagyl. However this wasn't the flagyl alone it was coz I'm extremely low potassium too at same time. I later read that flagyl passes through potassium while being processed obviously with no potassium in legs it allowed the flagyl to seep into muscles n bone releasing it's toxics n hense gobbling up my leg. Was very hard to convince docs of this at first. Everything that happens Me is hard to show up on some test n they think I'm mad. You can clearly see one leg smaller than other and thinner upon flexing.

The drug company should include an antidote in the fine print. When my mom took it for a urinary tract infection, it worked perfectly with no side effects."
120|121|sinus infection Woke up in the middle of the night really hot, by the time I got out of bed my body felt like it was on fire and stripping down didn't help! Took my temperature and no fever. Never experienced anything like that before. Told chiropractor and she said she's seeing multiple patients who had problems from being on this medication. Glad I stopped at 1 day!
121|122|depression headach memory loss nausea Don't waste your mney
122|123|Depression, anxiety Tremors, insomnia, slurred speech (maybe due to relaxed facial muscles?) I took one 20 mg dose about an hour before bedtime (10 PM). Woke in the middle of the night tossing and turning, don't think I slept a wink. Finally got some sleep around 7 AM with vivid dreams. When I woke up, I noticed some dizziness and more notably, tremors. Like I'm shaking from the cold, only I'm not cold. Forget doing anything having to do with precision or any heavy lifting, it isn't happening. I'm even having trouble typing. I'm not willing to put up with these side effects for any amount of time.
123|124|depression and anxiety I have started lexapro up twice. .. each time I go through a month of hell and then the side effects go away. I get severe anxiety, clammy/sweaty feet and hands, loss of appetite, stomach issues, shakiness, flu like symptoms, feeling of not being real, dilated pupils. After the first month, all those side effects go away and I do great. It gives me my life back and the only side effects I am left with is the sexual ones. There is no point in starting up an SSRI if you are going to give it at least 4 to 6 weeks to work. Start up side effects are common and can really stink, but they do end.
124|125|UTI Severe chills, high fever, severe headache, sore ribs, shortness of breath and cough, joint pain. I have taken this medicine previously with no significant side effects (gas, mild diarrhea). This time symptoms occurred within 5 hrs of taking first dose and came on very suddenly.
125|126|UTI Relief of UTI symptoms after 2nd dose; however, this was accompanied by muscle and joint aches and stiffness, fever, nausea, marked fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath. Have taken macrobid before without issues, but the nurse told me it isn't uncommon for reactions to worsen with repeated use (likely I had at least some mild fatigue before but ignored it). I will not be taking this drug again, and was rather disconcerted at the severity of my reaction to it. I felt like I had the flu.
126|127|UTI Shortness of breath, high fever, shaking, chills, exhaustion, headache After just one dose of this medication I spent the next 36 hours battling shortness of breath, high fevers, shaking, chills, headache. It was like being slammed with the flu. Fortunately I looked up side effects and saw that many others have experienced these same symptoms and I immediately discontinued use. After 36 hours of misery, I feel like I am now on the way to recovery.
127|128|Uti Chills, fever, headache, malaise, earache, nausea, loss of appetite. Extremely worrying side effects. Had to stop after taking just 3 tablets as I couldn't get out of bed. 48hrs later I still feel exhausted like I have a virus. NEVER again!
128|129|Possible uti Numbness in hands, tingling, extreme anxiety, very restless, contemplated suicide. Difficulty breathing. Unfortunately can't tolerate any antibiotics, tried this one and totally wasn't worth it. I will never take this again. Feels like your ingesting poison. Hope not to discourage anyone else, but definitely not for me.
129|130|UTI Shortness of breath. Feeling of doom l. Hazy breathing Not for ne
130|131|Bladder infection Body aches chills fever vomiting no appetite weakness This is the most poisonous drug Ive ever taken. With so many bad reviews it should be banned

132|133|To prevent UTIs after intercourse. non stop diarrhea and stomach upset i took it about 3pm and by 5 30 my stomach started getting very gassy and painful by 6 00 i had horrible diarrhea that lasted all night and continued into the morning still waiting for it to go away i only took that one pill but so far every i eat just runs right through me there s no way in hell i m taking any more

138|139|Ruptured calf muscle Excruciating stomach pain, constipation then diarrhea. Chills, bloating. I'd rather have my leg pain thanks. This drug is awful, it's been 15 hours since I took it and I'm still experiencing a lot of stomach pain, diarrhea and chills
139|140|Syatica Severe stomach pain and constant diarrhoea much worse than original condition. Took lanzrapole at same time to protect stomach did nothing! Only took 3 tablets over 24 hours later and still really ill from it.

142|143|Acud Reflux Headache, nausea, stomach cramps, extreme tiredness, shakes Taken on the first day prescribed and had stomach cramps. On the second day I had all of the above, not taken anymore since.
143|144|endometriosis/menstrual pain severe upper abdominal pain and swelling taking ponstel according to directions with food and a full glass of water gave me more pain than not having taken anything at all so much that it landed me in an emergency room it took about 24 hours after stopping this medicine for the pain and swelling in my upper abdomen to subside
144|145|To regulate my cycle/TTC acne vivd dreams small hot flashes i have to admit i was very scared to take this medication after ready the many comments about it i was very nervous about the nausea since i am my own boss and cant really take time off if i was ill luckily for me i had no nausea at all i took the pill at dinner as recommended by my dr one day i forgot and took it a bit after without food and felt a slight wave of nausea but nothing severe and it only lasted about 30 mins at night i had some hot flashes i ended up sleeping with the ac and the fan on i recommend taking it at night with dinner i have trouble skin to begin with so the extra hormones from the provera caused a wicked acne breakout nothing that can t be concealed and the pros totally out wiegh the cons i am took provera so i would get my period we are ttc and without a cycle clearly its impossible went 3 months without a period i was on 10mg day for 5 days my dr said i would get my period within 3 days after taking the last dose but i didn t actually get my period until 5 days after the last dose and once i did get it it was like any other regular period fairly light medium flow the first two days and light the last 2 days no cramping nothing unusal the provera did what it was supposed to do with very little side affects at all i now can start taking clomid in hopes of getting pregnant if you are worried about taking it just do it everyone is different and you might not have any side effects at all
145|146|Migraine My doctor gave me a sample pack when I told her that my previous medication Maxalt was taken much longer to take affect than it used to. I took the Replax with the onset of the migraine yet it took a full three hours before I felt any relief. Frequent unination and severe thirst, dry throat/mouth kept me awake for the remainder of the night. The next day I left very groggy and weak in the limbs. I do think think that I will be using Replax again and will stick with Maxalt.
146|147|UC headache sinus pain generally feeling of fatigue and achiness some nausea and twitching in my abdomen i ve had uc for six years which was reasonably under control this last flare up escalated which ultimately put me on steroids and remicaid i was very nervous about the remicaide but everything seem to go well my uc symptoms mainly the frequency of going to the bathroom has gone from 10 to maybe 3 4 times i still don t sleep through the night maybe it s the steroids but definite improvement after my first treatment having another one in 2 weeks hope things will only get better
147|148|crohn's disease none really maybe just a tad sleepy during the infusion remicade is nothing short of a maricle i am a 19 yr old premed college junior i was diagnosed with crohn s in 2007 after suffering from constant pain for 3 years in high school i was 5 5 and weighed 90 lbs at the time as i continued to drop my hs sweetheart split and the kids began to refer to me as ana short for anorexic although it was difficult i found ways to cope and improve myself however i came to realize that i was depressed and was bringing down those around me when it came time for freshman year of college i was accepted into my dream university but as my health exacerbated i was forced to turn down my admission and continue at a local comm college it was there that i got into an accident had an mri done and finally was diagnosed with crohn s i was later prescribed remicade for treatment for once i felt as if i could live normal again and if you could imagine i went through the final stages of puberty at the age of 18 i received a scholarship

155|156|Low Back Pain slightly drowsy but manageable metallic type of taste in mouth slightly disconnected so far i m loving this medication it s the only medication that has ever taken away my back pain i d say at the 98 pain free level and i ve tried a lot in the last 9 years degenerating discs si joint problems chronic pain for me the side effects are slight and nothing that prevents me from working or living my every day life i use it while taking ibuprofen to help reduce inflammation though the ibuprofen alone has never taken away the pain i m taking it at the 400 mg dose three times a day and the ibuprofen at 400 mg four times a day i only use it during periods of flare ups when the back goes out and seriously interferes with my life so the length of time taking the drug listed is really for this last flare up
156|157|Muscle pain one did me in this is a dangerous medication very dangerous felt nothing like going into a small coma doctor s are idiots
157|158|"Cervical Dystonia I felt like I had an ""out of the body"" experience. I remember walking downstairs from my bedroom and wondering later how I got there. This drug did something to my mind at that time and I decided to never go on it again. I had a bad experience with just one dose of Soma and never went back on it (see Side Effects). Some people call the ""coma-like"" state it can induce, ""Soma Coma"". I don't plan on ever taking it again due to my negative experience."

163|164|Uncontrolled Migraines None so far... I took the first dose last night before bed and I woke up today completely headache free!! I am on a taper increase dose so I will take 25 MG for one week, then increase to 50 MG for one week, then 100 MG at bedtime until reevaluated by my Headace Specialist. I hope this medication will help with my migraines. I have tried nearly everything else. If this medication works it will be worth any negative side effects. At least for me anyways!

167|168|ED Slightly flushed face and stuffy nose (although I can't confirm that as I tend to get stuff nosed sometimes anyway). Very rapid heartbeat. Started around 20 minutes after taking 25mg. Jumped up to 124, and slowly came down a little but was still rapid after 3 hours. Tried this due to personal issues, but will not be taking it again. Although it seems the rapid heartbeat is common and can be quite scary - I really don't like the feeling. And the results from what I took were nothing special to be honest. Won't be taking again - isn't worth the risk.
168|169|retain erection none i said wow this really works, im glad i only took 25mg,my wife said it was like a drill bit, as hard as steel

173|174|"Allergies I've rated Zyrtec previously mentioning vivid very strange dreams and nightmares. After having taken it on a few more occasions I've noticed that I feel terrible after taking it. (Note that I've only taken half-pills because the full pill makes me too sleepy.) After taking it always I feel like I am not being myself, have delusions, feel angry and ""high"" and like a zombie at the same time. In addition, I feel very sleepy, unable to concentrate and to make decisions, and also experience strong free-floating anxiety. This leads me to conclude that this drug influences the brain in some way. It would be reasonable to have this drug off the market to fully test it's side effects. It seems other site visitors have similar experience with this drug, and it needs to be further investigated. If you are considering taking this drug, stay away!"
174|175|Ragweed pollen allergies It feels like my brain is still asleep the next day. Tiredness, Lethargy, Brain fog, Sadness The morning after I took prescription Zyrtec I woke up extremely congested and irritated as if I hadn't taken an allergy pill. Apart from the fact that I still had all the allergy symptoms I had the added bonus of all the negative side effects of this medicine. I sat on my bed all day waiting for the side effects to wear off. I had a date later that evening and worried that I will appear depressed or miserable. This was so frustrating. I won't take this medication again 😔
175|176|Originally for hives Zyrtek is a toxic, addictive-like drug that should be ripped off of the market!!! I began taking it after a trip to the ER. It came highly recommended for my problems and I was completely allergic to Benadryl. Not only did I go from 112 pounds and pack on 20+ (Different each day due to severe water retention and swelling), but getting off this drug is torturous!!!!! Withdrawal symptoms include; more severe hives, angioedema, burning, all over and traveling itching, central nervous system taxation, chills with burning, need I go on????? This product disgusts me. My life is highly affected by the I'll effects of the fact that Zyrtek wants you to Rely on it in order to live, but you cannot live freely.
176|177|Major depression- with wellbutrin Weight gain I will say, I was just on here to see if anyone lost weight after abilify. After reading, I see a lot of issues I have must be also from the abilify. I recently stopped taking it because i'm so depressed over the weight gain. Initially. When I started two years ago, it was a miricle pill. Got me out of bed-gave my life back. I lost a lot of weight. Now the weight is coming back all in my belly. After stopping abilify, feel like a heavy blanket has been lifted off of me. I had been so drugged up and walking around in a fog. When I wake up in the morning, I've forgotten the details of the night before. My vision is blurred - even with glasses. I didn't have emotion. The list is long. I thought it was from another medication or combination of medications causing everything?

181|182|Dementia Extreme nausea, dizziness, seizure like feelings, almost ready to pass out, stomach pains. This is a dreadful medication just speaking from my personal experience. The very first day I took it I was so sick with nausea, stomach pains, dizziness, feeling of ready to pass out and feeling like I was going to have a seizure all day long. I couldn't even think, I was in so much destress. I stopped taking it and it took me three days to get this out of my system. My stomach hurt so badly I thought I had been poisoned. And my kidneys hurt. Please read the side effects before considering taking this drug.
182|183|Stress and anxiety just make me tired for the first time but now am fine nan
183|184|Car accident/tight muscles/Muscle Couldn't stay away when I first took them. Slurred speech, crazy thoughts, emotional, crying, anxiousness....Overall I wouldn't recommend it I wouldn't recommend to anyone with anxiety issues. Did relieve back pain!!
184|185|Epididymitis Brain fog, headache, lower back pain in kidney area I reluctantly resumed taking this anitibiotic, Bactrim DS (generic form), after I started to experience lower back pain after the first dose, because I didn't want to risk complications from untreated epididymitis (unproven that it was bacterial). The urologist who prescribed it convinced me to continue taking it for that reason and pooh-poohed the connection between kidney problems and the drug (obviously uninformed). The second pill that I took on the second day of treatment caused immediate brain fog and a very intense headache that lasted through the night. I am afraid to continue taking this antibiotic especially given that there's no proof that my epididymitis was caused by an infection. Just hope that I did not cause permanent neurological issues taking this drug. Ironically, the pain and inflammation in the affected testicle was reduced after I'd taken it but the positive anti-inflammatory effect is not worth risking long-term kidney or brain damage in my opinion. Will be reporting the adverse effects to the prescribing doctor's partner on call.
185|186|Bacterial infection in gut Severe persistant headache within an hour of taking the 1st pill dose. Fatigue, dizziness, nauceous, bad insomnia, feeling teary, dry mouth &amp; eyes, face pale &amp; slightly swollen. THE WORST DRUG EVER!! I am so angry my GP didnt give any warnings about possible side effects. When I reported my symptoms to the Dr he dismissed them as side affects, but told me to stop taking it if I felt unwell. After reading all these horrific reviews, Im surprised this drug isnt banned??!!!
186|187|crohns disease Well it does work. It slows things down and this helps alot. But it gives you a cheap high. The hangover affect the next day is just awful. It is very bad. It is just not worth taking. I only took Half of a 10mg and it was nasty. It works but so do nuclear weapons.

217|218|Migraines Excessive weight gain, fatigue, dizziness, feeling feint, pins and needles in hands In the two years I have taken Inderal I have gained 3 stone. I have tried every diet and I excercise a lot. The weight gain has really got me down because I was always skinny before this even after having a child. I was diagnosed with acute migraines by a neurologist and put on the tablets and I have not had an aura migraine since, however, I have had a lot of migraines where I am sick and see wavy lines regularly. No doctor seemed to want to admit that inderal was the cause for the weight gain but finally I saw one last week who is going to prescribe me an alternative. The fatigue is also a nightmare if you lead a busy life. I would advise anyone who is thinking about taking these tablets to take the side effects into account as they really have made my life miserable and it has taken me nearly a year to get a doctor to listen to me!

223|224|GAD dizzy, headache, felt in a fog, agitated, nausea My GAD hasn't been terrible over the years. Overall I handled it without requiring drugs. Infrequently took .25 alprazolam for tougher events. Having a particularly rough year with many stressful events occurring at the same time. Saw my doctor about this and the increased anxiety and he suggested I try Lexapro (alprazolam OK as needed). So I haven't had such a difficult time with anxiety under normal circumstances over the years. Felt so terrible with only two days of Lexapro (way worse than any anxiety I've felt) that I knew that it wasn't for me. I stopped taking it and will try to manage without drugs.... step up exercise... try meditation/relaxation techniques.

It went from the tip of my index finger and went all the way up my arm up into my neck to the side of my face. Needless to say I was so freaked out and went to urgent care that same morning and got off of it right away. I will never ever take this Medicine ever again. Horrible.

When I feel it coming on, I take a Serax and a Flexerel and I go to sleep and the problem ends. I only take one during the day if I feel myself becoming anxious, and it helps me to stay calm.

291|292|for pain after knee replacement In 2017, I had my right knee replaced. I had an overnight stay in the hospital and was given gabapentin and oxycodone for pain. The doc sent me home the following day with scrips for both. I took them both the first day and night at home, not really thinking much about it. The following morning when I woke up, I took the gabapentin first and figured I'd let it start taking effect before taking anything else. ( I DO NOT like to over medicate myself or mix prescription drugs, and at home I at least have control over that ). After about 25 minutes, I began feeling woozy, had big time head fog and had difficulty completing a thought. Could not focus. I would stand up to go do something, and immediately forget what it was. Although it took care of the pain, it made me feel very detached from reality. That was the last time I took it. I threw it out. I don't like anything that has that kind of effect on me mentally. I would never recommend this stuff to anyone - unless you enjoy being in a This drug - in my humble opinion - could be extremely dangerous to one's mental well being. And why is this anti seizure drug being used as a common pain killer?

293|294|DDD, spinal stenosis constipation. Take MiraLax for it. MiraLax is great. Was on ms contin but after taking over a year I would get about 6hrs of relief instead of nearly 12 hrs. Seems to be doing great. What I like is that there are no peaks and valleys with it. Its the same as ms contin. Only difference is the way it is released into your system. It feels more even, smoother.

300|301|UTI Nausea, chills, extreme muscle weakness, lethargy, elevated respiration, mental confusion, loss of appetite. This was prescribed for my 93 year old mother by her PCP for an asymptomatic UTI. My mother is cognitively intact and generally active. Day one was just nausea and chills. We persisted with the med and days two and three were truly horrible. She became so weak and confused that she could not stand unassisted or manage her clothes for toileting. We now know that this drug is not recommended for use in the elderly since 2012. She seems to be recovering immediately after stopping the Macrobid. Please research Macrobid before allowing your elder to take it.
301|302|Urinary Tract Infection After only 3 days on the pill my feet started burning and then in the middle of the night the pain and tingling moved up my legs and into my arms and hands. 7 months later I still have peripheral neuropathy from this drug. This is poison. Do not take it. My dr gave me this instead of Bactrim for no reason. I had taken Bactrim successfully for years. My life has been severely and drastically changed and my pain, tingling and burning is constant. I wish I could go back to that fateful day and never put that poison in my mouth. Don't think this can't happen to you, there are many documented cases, even going back to the 60s. This is the worst drug on the market in my opinion and with other antibiotics out there that work better I'm not sure why they use this anymore knowing the severe life changing side effects. Please take this off the market!!!
302|303|UTI Nausea, abdo swelling, dense headache, lethargy, mouth ulcers I am currently on day 2 of 3 and feel just as bad if not worse than before. Pain still in flanks and still blood and leukocytes in urine. Would have expected some improvement by now. Having to cancel Christmas meal tomorrow and if I continue feeling like this will be cancelling ski holiday! I've been told I'll be fit for work in a few days- can't see it at present. I'm a health professional and our service is already understaffed! Drugs causing side effects like these are costing the economy in sick leave- shameful.
303|304|bacteria in urine Severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, low grade fever. Feeling of having the flu after second dose. Stomach pain and vomiting continue and haven't had a dose in 24 hours. Just several hours after the second dose of this antibiotic I considered taking my 15 year old daughter to the ER. She has no allergies to any other medication, this particular antibiotic is dangerous and needs to be pulled off the market before someone dies! DO NOT TAKE THIS ANTIBIOTIC!! I'm beyond angry that our nurse/doctor prescribed this to our daughter (especially since she had no symptoms of a UTI, just bacteria found when doing a urine for something else).
304|305|UTI I am supposed to be on it for 7 days, I've always taken Cipro before with little problems otherwise than a tendency for a yeast infection after. But yesterday I had a severe headache that lasted all night, I was putting ice packs on it. And today I feel achy, mainly in my upper body but some in my legs, similiar to maybe a flu. And I felt so bad after class today I laid down for a bit and had 2 episodes of some odd form of tachycardia. I literally could feel my heart pounding in my entire body, timed my heart rate and it was actually in the 120s while I was just lying there. It normally runs 80-90s even when up and minimally active. It converted back to a normal rhythym, I've never had an episode like that and I have no cardiac history. It was a bit bizarre. It has cleared up my UTI, and I am a big advocate of finishing a course of antibiotics to prevent resistant strains, But if I feel just as bad tomorrow, I am going to have to contact my prescriber and tell em to pick anothe Never had any side effects before, and if it was just the ache I might continue but the heart rate threw me off a bit. That really isn't a side effect that is normal, especially for someone as active as I am.

329|330|For Insomia and Anxiety severe daytime drowsiness and anticholinergic brain fog avoid it like the plague it only creates a false drowsiness that you never would have had otherwise and the drowsiness doesn t go away after a few hours wouldn t you rather have your life energy back so that you can function during the day rather than be sedated into a false soporific stupor all day
330|331|"Rash (poison ivy?) Overwhelming drowsiness, lingering 24+ hours after ceasing the medication. (Half life of 8 hours = around 2 days to eliminate completely.) Mild headache and dizziness. To be fair, I don't find the words ""non-drowsy"" anywhere on Zyrtec's web site, so I can't claim they misled me. But for me, the drowsiness and fatigue caused by this medication has been so overwhelming and long-lasting that it's worse than useless. I'd only touch this stuff in the event of a literally life-threatening allergic reaction, and then only if I can't get my hands on an EpiPen. Worse, it didn't seem to do much for my rash."

356|357|C-Diff warning to c diff patients flagly was not only ineffective in curing my c diff infection in my opinion it contributed to my near death battle with c diff nine years ago i recently contracted c diff again as a result of taking an antibiotic and my infectious disease team said they are finding that flagyl is not effective for c diff although i understand that doctors are advised to prescribe flagyl initially i recommend that you closely monitor your symptoms if the diarehha isn t controlled quickly consider requesting vancomycin finally i would highly recommend that an infectious disease team provide medical treatment my pcp was not capable of managing the illness and i nearly died monitor your symptoms closely understand the side effects and ask to switch to vancomycin if flagyl doesn t work quickly
357|358|Possible infection due to UC Was prescribed flagyl for a possible infection causing my UC to flare up. By day 3 I lost all energy. I don't have the metallic taste or headaches but the fatigue and space feeling are unbearable. Feel depressed and have no appetite. I called my Dr and they insist to finish the regimen of pills. Absolutely not this is absolutely the worst drug EVER and no one should take it. I am stopping immediately and if ever prescribed again I will refuse it. I hope once it's out of the system I can function normally. Should be BANNED!!'

360|361|Bacterial infection Anxiety,panic attacks,palpitations, dark urine,nausea I was prescribed 500 mg 2x a day for bacterial infection and it did start to clear up quickly. However the side effects were awful and gave me such bad anxiety and panic attacks and palpitations that I could no longer stand the way this medication made me feel.

362|363|Suspected Giardia i have a dull headache am experiencing exhaustion and right after i take the pill a sharp gas pain in upper stomach which is relieved with belching the general flatulence and diarrhea is attributable to the bug so i can t say the meds are to blame these effects come in waves and thus make me frightened and panicky i have noticed this after starting the 4th day of treatment if i lie down and try to stay calm the fatigued feeling passes it s a weird suppressed feeling since if i take a deep breath i can get lots of air yet i feel out of breath during those spells i am more fearful of what may be wrong with me than of the drug which can be stopped my tests have so far not been conclusive for giardia once the intermittent effects pass and i calm down i realize that the awful gnawing sensation in my tummy is being helped i do not know where i would have picked up giardia i did not drink from a stream have no kids etc but since stool tests for other stuff came back negative and this fit the symptoms i am being treated the first thing i noted was the stranglehold on my esophagus was relieved after the second day on the meds so i assume they are working

365|366|Sinus infection Extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, feeling depressed and like I'm going to die. This is a very powerful medication that should only be given those who are in the hospital. It did cure the sinus infection quickly but made me very ill. I'm allergic to penicilin and z-pak so the doc is running out of options but will never take this poison again!
366|367|Bronchitis Day 4, 4th pill January 2013 I felt like I was hit by a truck, unable to rise up on toes or back on heels, clearly neurological deficit, pain in all muscles but horrid from lumbar down. I realized I was poisoned. I shuffled, unable to lay on back due to calve pain but needed to elevate painful swollen legs, laid on my side but it was painful to sleep. I ruptured my biceps lowering a laundry basket 7 mos after I stopped the poison. I was in a wheelchair at 11 mos to 12 mos due to unable to walk over 30 ft due to pain but I couldn't push a wheelchair due to torn bicep unless on level ground and then it was painful. It took 1 yr to heal the bicep. I still use crutches and have daily pain and shuffle some times. I worked up until month 21 mos post taking 4 pills, just 4. it was stupid to take this antibiotic for bronchitis. It has left me with damage preventing me from working as an occupational therapist. The doctor who prescribed it for me asked if I ever had leg cramps and he refused to give me a steroid inhaler whcih would have made the adverse effect worse.
367|368|triglycerides over 2000 rectal bleeding, bloody nose, abdominal cramps, extremely tired, soft stool, rushing after eating, headache, gas, some diahreah. Just hated everything this medication did to me and how It made me feel. My system just hated it from day one.
368|369|UTI chills, muscle aches (especially hips &amp; legs), rash, fatigue great medicine if you're not allergic; horrible if you are allergic - I had taken macrobid once before for a UTI with no problem &amp; it cleared up my UTI. I just began taking it recently again for another UTI. On the first night after having had 2 doses, I began shivering in bed uncontrollably for 2 1/2 hours that night; my muscles began aching, &amp; I had a bad headache. I assumed I had caught the flu (as it is flu season). I felt horrible the next day (day 2) continuing the chills off and on, and continuing with aching muscles, headache, and fatigue. Day 3, I developed a pale rash on my arms and legs along with the previous symptoms. Day 4, the rash spread to my chest and the other symptoms continued. Day 5, I stopped the macrobid and saw my doctor. My doctor said the UTI had cleared so I could stop the macrobid..He thought the rash was definitely a result of the macrobid, but thought the other symptoms were probably due to a virus I probably picked up. After reading reviews here, I feel sure all of my symptoms were due to the macrobid, and will not be taking it again.
369|370|"UTI After first dose developed a migraine-like headache with sensitivity to light. Then over the next 2 days nausea and shaking chills so bad that I could not get warm. 2 down blankets and the heat at 70. Fever hovered around 100-101. No appetite. On day 4, I developed hives on my chest shoulders, face and scalp- I felt much sicker than I did from the simple UTI. Called my doctor and stopped the drug. The next day I developed angioedema- face, hands,feet. Immediately I took about 50mg of liquid Benadryl (which I keep on hand) because I was afraid my tongue and throat might become involved and I was headed for full anaphylaxis. It took 5 days for the facial edema to simmer down but it still flares. It's now 8 days after stopping the drug and I seem to have ""serum sickness"". Swollen joints, red burning patches of skin over my joints, face and ears, extreme fatigue, edema, and decreased urine output (kidney involvement). I see an immune specialist next week. This is not for everyone. When I stopped taking it my doctor said ""3 days is usually more than enough"". Then why prescribe 7 days? Unfortunately I am allergic to sulfa so they gave me this. Never again! I think a drug named nitrofurantoin should cause concern to begin with. I felt like it was going to kill me."
370|371|Uti This medication almost killed my mom. She prescribed this medicine for UTI infection she was taken to the ER on a Friday night and was hospitalized for a week. She suffered extreme difficulty breathing and was placed on a bipap machine which is basically life support. She got out of the hospital and is still on oxygen and the doctors don't know yet if the damaged caused is permanent or not yet. Up until this time she was a healthy person who didn't have any major health issues, now she has the shakes,confusion,vomiting,loss of appetite,body aches,depression,etc. This medication is a life changing drug that may have altered my mother's life and our families lives forever. I had my wife call our families doctors office and add this medication to our allergic reaction medications. There is absolutely no way in the world no one in my family will ever take this POISON,and anyone that takes this stuff is a fool. I wish my mother's doctor would be more aware of the thousands of people this drug has changed and altered forever. You know you put your trust in your doctors hands and the pharmaceutical companies that they have your best interests at hand and when they don't and it's up to you too make sure you do hundreds of hours of research taking this medication. Since this event i have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on line reading about this medicine and there are no good responses or stories about macrobid just horrible experience. I can't believe the FDA allows this POISON This drug is not meant for human consumption and to make people sicker than they already are
371|372|urinary tract infection this drug was prescribed to me after exploratory surgery to find out why i was getting recurrent urinary tract infections i reacted acutely to this drug first symptoms a massive depression within three days then the feeling that my body was rapidly shutting down almost program by program like a computer about to crash the hospital emergency unit did not know what was wrong with me i think they suspected creational drugs and still i gor sicker finally by end of day four when i felt i was really staring death in the eye i suddenly in a moment of lucidity clicked that it was the macrodantin even after a detox fast lots and lots of water it still took me almost six months of therapy and acupuncture treatment to finally get back to a normal life the therapy was to help me deal with the immense anger and sense of betrayal i experienced against the prescribing doctor who basically laughed my problems off even though i pointed out that the drug was speciffically unsuited to three conditions i had in fact i never had a urinary tract infection i actually had infected kidneys

373|374|Lower back pain Heart palpitations, constant ringing in my ears, feeling dizzy. Started with severe back pain that spread to my chest. It felt like i was being crushed, difficulty breathing. The Heart palpitations, constant ringing in my ears, feeling dizzy started about 7 days after stopping the med. After four days on Naproxen I though I was having a Heart attack. Ended up in an Ambulance taken to A&amp;E. Two Months on and I'm still wrecked. This med should be BANNED!

383|384|SVT diarrhea, back ache I just switched to this from Diltiazam 4 days ago. My lower back aches so much...hoping it goes away after a short while once my body has adjusted. Also have diarrhea, but not as bothersome as the aching back.
384|385|chronic cough did nothing did nothing i kept coughing until i was couching up blood
385|386|"Headache Doctor prescribed for chronic headache. It didn't do shit for the headache. I could tolerate the tingling feelings on my hands. I had sharp stomach pain every night that I took the pills. However, the depressing thoughts were what got me to stop. I am not a depressed person and I try to have a positive perspective on life. But since the day I've been on medication I felt mellow, and then I started to think about some deep depressive thoughts consistently. Now I can understand how medication can drive a person to a suicidal thought. Other little side effects for me- drowsiness during the day, constipation, blurred vision. People - don't take this medication bc you see ""weight loss"" as a plus. It's a dangerous drug. The possible side effects are not worth risking your health to be thinner."
386|387|Back spasms No negative side effectes to my knowledge. I have been suffering severe back spasm pain every few days for the past week. The first day I was injected with Valium at the ER and it helped a great deal. The second time, which was about five days later, I tried EVERYTHING and it didn't relieve the spasm or the pain; heating pad, 600 mg of Motrin, icy hot, lying down, hot shower, nothing. I finally went to my last resort of oral Valium. It took about half an hour to kick in but when it did, I finally felt relief in my back and was finally able to sleep. I don't want to rely on this drug because of addiction that runs in my family, so I will be seeing a primary care doctor to see why my back is doing this and take the actions necessary to deal with this problem. Bottom line: great drug for back spasms, as long as you take it as a last resort to lessen the risk of dependence on it.
387|388|Anxiety sleepyness sedation hangover groggyness the medication did not help me with anxiety i still experience chills headache anxiety while on the medication um the type sedation was kindof calming however and got lots of sleep too much sleep though and not practical med for anxiety in my opinion especially when attempting to take as needed as the withdrawl effects are noticable mentioning a history of drug abuse affected the use of anxiety medication with my nurse
388|389|Depression of stomach probably Sexual dysfunction, no orgasm, very low libido, persistent brain fog. I went to doctor for my acid reflux and as it turned out he prescribed this poison to me without even telling me what this shit is and what does it do to my body.i have stopped taking sertraline for 4 days now and the side effects haven't worn off yet.

391|392|Asthma shakiness i m allergic to other rescue inhalers and this one has worked wonders for me
392|393|UTI Nausea, muscle aches, headache, lightheaded, dizziness,fatigue,heartburn, loss of appetite. A week after starting Bactrim &amp; 2 days after finishing I developed hives,itching &amp; a fast heartbeat. Took an antihistamine that settled down the rapid heartbeat &amp; helped with the itching. Do not take this drug the side effects are miserable, it was like having the flu, you can't even function.
393|394|UTI Immediately after my first dose, my thumb swelled and turned bright red. It has a prickly, itchy painful sensation. I continued taking the Bactrim but this strange side effect was becoming unbearable. My joints in my thumb ache and in our keyboard centric society, typing at work was unbearable. I switched to amoxicillan, Dr thankfully called and told me that the culture came back with a resistant to Bactrim bacteria. The sore, tingly, burning thumb is still swollen but it has only been a day. Don't recommend
394|395|infection from burn headache, sweating, nasty taste in mouth/ cottonmouth. a little muscle weakness. not too bad side effects were okay. i always made sure i had food in my system when i took them.
395|396|Tachycardia, high BP Terrible diarrhea, bad nausea. But the worst thing was what it did to me mentally. Heavy depression, broke down sobbing, for no reason I could think of, every time I was alone. Depressed and had suicidal thoughts (uncharacteristic for me) and very irritable. Very tired in a depressed sort of way. I felt like aliens were controlling my mind. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because it did lower my BP, but too much. Now I am off the med and feel normal again. The cause of the BP turned out to be chronic pain, which has resolved now, so I don't need a beta-blocker anymore.
396|397|Server sinus infection Server joint pain also pain lower left side heart beat under bottom of rib cage,upper lip feels weird and crazy headaches at night I'm kind of worried as I do have major health issues I hope this ain't going to screw me up even more I also hate going to hospital because when I go it's always to the trauma department!!!

398|399|Fertility Testing i lost my mind no kidding worst experience of my life it was a test to see if my estrogen levels were acceptable for ivf at age 45 pushing my reproductive system to the limit 100mgs a day for 5 days the doctor and the package insert and all available information said there should be no side effect the nurse said maybe i d be a little emotional cry at tv commercials this was gross understatement i completely lost control of my emotions and my mind i horrific thought would enter my mind and i could not turn away from it i had a meltdown just sitting in the salon no reason their continued denials sent me to a psychiatrist who also knew nothing about these effects only once i was accepted into ivf program and met their psychologist she told me about the branch clomidians reference to the branch davidians a bit of humor and how often this drug melts women s minds it took about 3 months for the effects to completely wear off as i helped a friend with breast cancer unrelated and faced my own cancer scare

428|429|"Sciatica from herniated disc Dizziness, feeling high like when on ecstasy, sweating, delayed orgasm, involuntarily waking up mornings at 7:00AM with crazy noises in my brain Doc prescribed it to my sciatica coming from a herniated disc. Was on Lyrica before but it only helped a bit. Worked very good against the pain, I felt almost nothing the second day on, but suddenly I started feeling high and ""light"" like when on ecstasy, sometimes I wouldn't even feel my legs properly. Would wake up every morning at 7AM (regardless of when I went to sleep) with a zap on my brain and some crazy music playing in it. Works really good for the nerve pain, but the side effects weren't worth it.I felt ""unnatural"", always numb."

448|449|c diff Extreme tiredness, loss of appetite, food tasted awful, swollen knee with severe pain. Rash that was redish and purplish above elbow. Rash itched and head itched like I had fleas. Luckily my daughter realized these were side effects and pointed this out to the doctor who finally stopped the poisonous drug. Horrible drug. Unfortunately doctors don't know the side effects and are too willing to add another drug to counter the side effects of a drug instead of thinking outside the box. Doctors are nothing more than drug pushers anymore. Very sad.
449|450|BV numb arm constipation irritability nausea lack of appetite anxiety uncontrolled cry bad gas bloating horrible metallic taste exhaustion rapid heartbeat confusion sleeplessness this drug is absolutely horrible i didnt realize until today that the reason all these things were happening to me was because of flagyl my irritablity was so severe today that all i wanted to do is cry i finally felt so bad that i got on this website what a blessing and read what the other users experiences as well it was so nice to see that i wasn t the only one what is really scary is that i have been taking 500mg twice a day for 5 days now and i am nine months pregnant the ob said it is safe in pregnancy but that scares me knowing that everything i am enduring maybe happening to my baby too needless to say i am not taking the last two days of flagyl and will never take this drug again

455|456|giardia very few slight lethargy loopiness vertigo naseous if i didn t take with lots of food vivid dreams i was certain this drug would be a nightmare based on what i ve read here i even put off taking it and tried the natural herbal alternatives for a week to no avail within 24 hours of taking flagyl my giardia symptoms were virtually gone after three weeks of terrible stomach pain bloating diarrhea the relief was heavenly i found that eating a ton drinking plenty of water supplementing with probiotics milk thistle capsules to protect liver virtually eliminated all side effects i just finished 500 mg 3x day for 5 days and i feel back to normal again
456|457|Intestine parasite a couple of times i had a very mild upset stomach 1 hour after taking lasting 20 mins or less no other problems other people have written horrible things about this drug but for me i really did not experience anything worse than asprin side effects i guess it varies greatly with individuals

458|459|Migraines Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, stomach pains/nausea, depression, difficulty concentrating, aggression, vivid dreams, loss of personality. I began taking this because I was having migraines everyday. It didn't help my migraines any, but I didn't really give it a chance to. After 5 days of the side effects I decided they weren't worth it.
459|460|Firbo and failed back surgery Dry mouth, trouble urinating, dropsies with my wrists when holding something, terrible constipation...grrrrrr For the last 7 years I have been on 30 mg. MS contin with 15 mg. morphine IR 3 x'day. My pain Dr. put me on 1-100 mg. of kadian per day. Kadian is not near as effective as the MS contin and the morphine IR was. I am going to ask to go back on them and quit the kadian. My pain was pretty much at a 3-4 on a daily basis, but with the kadian it has jumped up to a 6.
460|461|tonsillitis Cramping/ bad diarrhea. Nausea. Started first pill Started first pill (500 mg) on Thursday and by the following Monday night I stopped taking the meds because at 2 am Tuesday morning I was living in the bathroom! Today is Friday and I am somewhat back to the living. The Diarrhea has stopped and I am able to keep something on my stomach but still having very mild nausea. Eating more yogart which is helping. Called the doctor's office and told them what was going on and that I wanted it noted in my chart that under no uncertain circumstances was I ever to be prescribed this med again.
461|462|epilepsy Insomnia but when I do get to sleep, I keep waking up.... anxiety, weepy, headaches, diarrhea, severe body aches, increased appetite. In fairness, I have only been on Lamictal for about five days. I was put on this in place of Vimpat as I was on that for about two months and became angry, aggressive and suicidal. I was off of the Vimpat for two days before starting this. I felt great for one day...and then started on this one and started to feel like crap within hours. My very first night, could not sleep for the first time in years and it has been this way since. Headaches and body aches started within about 48 hours and anxiety and weepy within the past two days. My doctor has me at a slow titration and this current dose is just a quarter of what my full dose will be. I am not happy at all and very frustrated with doing test drives on meds to get the seizures under control.
462|463|Severe Bronchitis Tingling, pins and needles in almost every muscle in my arms and legs, tendon pain in my left Achilles, anxiety attacks, nightmares, too many issues to list ONLY TAKE THIS DRUG IN A LIFE OR DEATH CONDITION! It didn't cure my bronchitis. In the end I had to switch to another antibiotic. Anyone who had bad side effects to this drug, ask your doctor to place a notice in your medical records for allergic reaction to flouroquinilones. You never know one day you might be unconscious and they might administer it by IV. My story is very lengthy, as it took me almost a full year to recover from Levaquin. I believe this drug did damage to my nervous system. After much intensive research, the solution to reverse the toxic effects of this drug was found to be Glutathione. I ate lots and lots of spinach for a full year to reverse the effects. After about 6 months I started to feel normal again, and after a year I was near 100%. If you have low glutathione stores, and you take this drug, you are done. It depletes glutathione quickly, and once that is gone, it is open season on your nervous system. I have read many studies on this issue, and I feel really bad for some people who took damage from this drug early on, before the research about the glutathione effects were available. Anyway.... I'm better now, and as much as I'd like to say I'd never take it again, if I had an unresponsive infection and there was nothing else to cure it, I would if there was a chance to save my life. But under no other circumstance would I take it again!
463|464|"Suspected infection HORRIFIC INSOMNIA, severe fatigue, severe anxiety, tendon pain, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy, breathing issues, irregular heart rate, diarrhea. Months later all would lead to thyroid and hormone issues. One week after taking this drug, I tossed my dog his stuffed dog toy and tore my rotator cuff. Ever since taking this drug, I easily hurt myself with daily activities (tendons and muscle damage). Warning label should include the word PERMANENT because it has been TWO years since taking Levaquin and the side effects have not gone away. It should also tell patients that this is a CHEMOTHERPAY drug which damages ALL the cells in your body not just the infection. To make the effects worse, my cortisol shot through the roof due to the damage this drug did to my body. Now my adrenal glands have worn out and I am experiencing adrenal fatigue. I was healthy before taking this drug- my life has been a nightmare ever since. Side effects are not as ""rare"" as the drug companies would lead you to believe. They are under reported because doctors refuse to believe/report them. I live my life in daily pain now &amp; would never have believed that could happen from an ""antibiotic."" My whole life changed due to this drug. I used to hike 10-20 miles easily and now walking one mile is a struggle. I would rather die than ever take Levaquin again. Think twice before you take this- if you do have a reaction, it will change your life forever and not in any good way."
464|465|Mis-diagnosed diverticulitis It started with excruciating tendon pain, especially in my knees, both front and back. I had knees and shoulders popping, buzzing feelings in assorted areas of my body, heart palpitations, pain in the chest that felt like it was connective tissue between the heart and left lung, anxiety, brain fog, and fatigue. This is poison! I took those five pills over three years ago, and the tendon issues won't go away. I often have to use a cane to walk. I still have occasional popping of joints, buzzing feelings, and feelings like I've got bugs on my scalp. About six months ago, due to my brain fog, I had to handle a wet tablet in my left hand to put it in a pill crusher before dissolving it to put in my dying father's feeding tube, and within two hours, I had tendon pain going up my left arm, then my shoulder, finally going all the way into my Achilles tendon after about ten hours. Now, I never know when I'll be blessed with a day in which I don't have to deal with the pain -- when I can walk normally. It's with me all the time, and I can't find a way to get rid of the pain.
465|466|uti Day 3...I broke out in red bumps on my shoulders and chest. Had tingling in my hands and feet. Tingling in my hands would go up my arm into side of head behind ear. Stomach pain. Kept having shortness of breath. Have not taken in 7 days now but still have itchy rash that is getting worse. Still get very short of breath. General feeling of feeling unwell. My Drs. keep coming up with other excuses for my symptoms, but I know its from the generic version of macrobid. THIS MEDICINE SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO ANYONE...EVER!
466|467|UTI Nausea, stomach ache, vomitting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue. I take this for my UTI's because the i'm resistant to many other antibiotics. This stuff makes me feel like I'm dying. The nausea lasts all day and night and I feel so weak at every moment. It makes me puke even when I take it with lots of food and water. This is an absolutely terrible drug. DO NOT TAKE IT.
467|468|UTI Flu like symptoms, no energy, achy joints. 6 weeks later, still low energy and have tendon issues. Don't take this toxic drug!!!!
468|469|UTI I literally feel as if I were poisoned. Day 1 Dose 1, I only ate toast and then took it. I could not get out of bed. The waves of nausea were extreme. The remaining days I ate a heavy carb meal and waited 20-30 min then took the pill. The nausea was still pretty bad, but I could get out of bed to make it to the couch. I wake up every morning with diarrhea and this morning I puked 2x. I am so sore and tired. My head is so heavy I need naps about every 3 hours. This is so ridiculous. I went to urgent care to receive help so I could work and instead get poisoned. I have yet to see one single positive review. There are SO SO many better alternatives. I even told the doc I had been given Cipro in the past and it had worked, but she ignored it. Take this off the market. I have never ever had a reaction to a drug until now.
469|470|UTI Headaches, severe body aches &amp; fatigue, nausea, I began feeling horrible about one hour after taking this medicine. I took the second dose and felt like I had the worst case of influenza ever. I then began looking up side effects and discovered that this does happen to some people. Went to urgent care where it was confirmed that these are side effects of the medication and was switched to a different antibiotic. Felt so much better within 24 hours and back to normal after 48 hours from the last dose. Who knows what may have happened if I had continued taking this the entire 5 days. Urgent Care noted in my file to never prescribe this medication to me again.
470|471|Uti Headache, lower back pain, sharp pain in legs, muscle weakness, lower back pain,diarreah,facial pain. This is the second day I've taken it. I have trigeminal neuralgia and this medication seems to trigger those nerves because of the headache. Im afraid to continue taking it because of the nerve pain.
471|472|uti extreme fatigue, severe muscle/joint pain, minor shortness of breath. hoarseness recommend anyone prescribed ask dr for something less toxic. this should be medication of last resort if other drugs don't work. on day 4 of 5 uti much better, side effects are minor but were extreme within 45minutes of taking. extreme fatigue (taking shower, making dinner. load of laundry), &amp;muscle/joint pain was debilitating. bed-ridden fri-sun, missed work, had to ask nana to care for kids. loss of appetite, weight loss. i have to force myself to eat bowl of oatmeal 30min. before taking to avoid upset stomach and vomiting. shortness of breath was minor but nonetheless frightening. yesterday/today minor hoarseness.no diarrhea but then again i take probiotic daily. woke up with cold sore today so clearly body fighting a bug, possibly had undetected low grade fever. if prone to anxiety or sadness, be aware the side effects could trigger or exasperate those feelings - this should be included in the warnings. i'm allergic to most antibiotics so in my case i have to suck it up one more day and pray infection and side effects go away.
472|473|Urinary Tract Infection Nausea, chills, hot flashes, diarrhea, upset stomach, headaches, vaginal itching, fever, shaking, anxiety, sleep deprivation (due to the side effects) and lack of food in system (any scented foods made me even more nauseous) Macrobid works to the extent that your UTI symptoms are relieved around 48 hours after taking it. But the side effects are horrendous and I would rather not take again.
473|474|severe lower back pain i experienced anger and irritability however it was worth it for my back day two i felt exteremely better and able to do normal days activities nan
474|475|Kidney Stones helps me get comfortable enough at night to sleep well all night if taken during the day it makes me very sleepy if i am not active if i stay up and moving it does not make me sleepy definitely takes the pain away but it does not last very long i could probably take it every two or three hours although that is not recommended overall i say it is a very good pain med thank goodness i have not experienced any of the hallucinations that other people say they have had from it

476|477|Severe menstrual cramps Dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, light-headedness and made me feel very disorientated This drug did nothing but make me feel worse and had me sent home twice from nearly fainting in class. Wouldn't touch the stuff again as it's a bloody poison!

Pretty soon I noticed that our normally easy-going, sweet boy turned aggressive, and completely over-reacted to things which frustrated him. His heart seemed to be racing faster than normal also. I realised this started the first day he was on Zyrtec. This one has been tipped down the sink! I'll be looking for more natural alternatives. Should have known better than to trust a pharmaceutical drug!

527|528|Kidney Stones Was prescribed this for a urinary tract infection after passing a kidney stone. Within a few days of starting levaquin I began having severe back and leg pain. Two days later I developed a headache that would not go away. I also had my sleeping rhythms get all messed up and my hands and arms developed neruopathy with the classic pins and needles feeling . I'm a week off of levaquin and the headache is now finally going away and my hand and arms feel normal again, but I'm extremely fatigued and walking is difficult for me due to the pain and weakness in my leg. Fortunately I have not experienced any tendon or issues, but my head is in a fog that will not go away. My boss at work has had a similar experience and is willing to deal with these issues while I hopefully recover. After making the connection and reading about this drug, I'm appalled that it's being used so freely by doctors.

545|546|Plantar Fasciitis Well the first few days the inflammation in my foot seemed to disperse. I was feeling better. My stomach began to bloat within a few hours of taking it. It wasn't until day 6 did the real pain hit. I was up all night. The pain was worse than contractions. At least with those I got a break. The next day I realized naproxen was the culprit and stopped taking it. One week later now, my stomach is still bloated. No gas, no constipation. Just really bloated and uncomfortable. I've been eating small meals, I workout like crazy, but nothing seems to help. I'm healthy, other than the plantar fasciitis. This constant bloat started when I began napoxen. My diet (healthy) has not changed.

They are not unusual reactions to any drug that is a fluoroquinolone, but nobody believes EYE DROPS will do this. But they do. They roll down inside the tear duct and into the spongy absorbent nasal tissue and BAM! THe only way to get a more intense dose would be to inject it i.v.. This stuff is horrible. I wanted to be dead by the end of it. I've had bad reactions to other fluoroquinolines and told the Dr. this, but she blew it off. NEVER AGAIN. From now on I'll just tell them I'm allergic to it and save myself the 10 days (effects keep on even once you stop taking it) of hell.

After having flu for over 2weeks with home remedies no longer working I asked for anti biotics as my cough was pretty bad and I couldant shift the mucus. I was given these to take 4times a day for a week as I'm allergic to penicillin... Instantly had all the side effects from this anti biotic felt worse and it didn't seem to be shifting my cough that well after being on day four and extremely ill I rang the emergency line to be told their not the best but not the worst anti biotic to take and it's more likely viral symptoms even though I had none of the above before taking the medicine only the awful cough. Told to continue the dose and still use home remedies I found paracetamol helped with these alittle... And to go back to the doctors if it persists to possibly change them but theirs not much luck of that with my local surgery always being out of spaces... Definitely not an anti biotic I'd take again that's for sure.

624|625|BV metallic taste depression throbbing sporadic headaches only felt on right side dark urine loss of appetite the only reason i rated this a 5 is because it worked for my condition today is day 7 last day of taking these and i can t wait til it s all out of my system the actual taste of the pill is disgusting you taste it as soon as it hits the tongue the metallic taste was evident from day 1 i d even wake up in the morning with it yuck the throbbing headaches came about on day 6 and only seemed to affect the right side of my head it even hurt to touch my scalp and ear on that side the depression hit around day 3 4 feelings of low self worth and anxiety loss of appetite was a biggie although i d be hungry as soon as i had food in front of me i didn t want to physically eat it strange

628|629|BV after taking the first dose i became very drowsy and the next day had lots of gas followed by loose stools and headaches nausea what has helped is to eat a big meal or peanutbutter snack take with food and fluids also probiotics like lactobacillus i got over the counter at wallmart the flagyl takes out good bad bacteria in the intestional tract so you must replace the good bacteria with acidophyllis lactobacillus and the gas loose stools go away this will help you get thru this ordeal while you are taking flagyl
629|630|BV i just took my first 500 mg dose and the taste was bad but bearable within a few minutes i feel like i just smoked crazy im taking this drug for bv first time the most disgusting infection ever however my doctor said not to drink and i am leaving for spring break tommorrow and i know i will drink dont know what to do hopefully at least the smell will clear up in 2 days and then i will continue treatment when i get back to school is this a bad idea let me know please

631|632|bacterial vaginosis nausea backache mild abdominal pain severe headache dark urine frequent urination diarrhea muscle weakness dizziness fatigue it seemed to start working within the first few doses but the side effects have not been pleasent frequent urination set in 2 days into taking it and now i feel like i have to go all the time probably one of the most annoying side effects my head hurts very bad and i m dizzy feel nauseous all day even when taken on a full stomach not to mention the taste is horrible and stays in your mouth for a long period of time drinking something like juice or milk helps but makes whatever it is you re drinking taste just as bad at first also my pills are not coated so i have gotten it stuck in my throat a few times which makes the taste 10 times worse it seems to work well but you ll have to put up with some bad side effects to cure whatever you have
632|633|Infected fallopian tube(removed) nasty nasty bitter taste all day loose stools i have had a rapid heart rate but don t know if its related also nausea when taking with dicloxicillin spelling but i attribute that to the latter and not the flagyl side effects seem nasty but then the germs are worse make sure you take it all
633|634|Dental & sinus infection moderate dizziness and light headedness some anxiety and increased fatigue prescribed flagyl and amoxicillin worked extremely well against dental infection prior to starting this course infection was spreading rapidly through facial spaces was quickly brought under control within 3 4 days seems my experience is more positive than many on here for dental problems people suffering severe reactions to flagyl may want to ask their doctor about alternatives such as erythromycin which tend to have less extreme effects most disturbing effect was a vertigo like dizziness thankfully so far this has been relatively short term though would recommend flagyl for dental infection even if effects are unpleasant as this can quickly become very serious if left untreated
634|635|BV dizziness fatigue nauseousness stomach upset depression anxiety frequent urination loss of appetite didn t have a decent night s sleep the whole week i was on the antibiotic yet i ve never felt so tired in my entire life i also felt very light headed dizzy while taking it no appetite either despite all of the negative side effects it seems to be clearing up my infection still have 2 more days to go though so we ll see

637|638|NSU - Chlamydia Side effects are really a pain the a**. Nausea,dizzines,back pain,letargia,stomach disorders,diarrhea. I felt like a dead man walking. Well,despite the side effects it's the only drug able to kill Chlamydia Thracomathis.I did a first course with Zythromax , 1 gram in a single dosage but it didn't work.I went on Ilosone,500mg.every 6 hours x 7 days and finally my NSU was solved.
638|639|Migraines distrubing dreams numbness in limbs skin irritation was perscribed this drug to help treat chronic migraines was awakened within the first few nights of taking this drug by weird and disturbing dreams noticed tingling and numbness in my fingers and toes as well the last straw was waking up with a skin rash across my chest shoulders and back i know my doctor is trying to be proactive in preventing migraines before they occur but this drug is not for me although sumatriptans are a reactive solution to a migraine the inderal is just not worth the side effects
639|640|Gout had gout for over a month allopurinol had brought uric acid under control but gout was not going away was prescribed up to 3x a day but only took 1x a day definitely take with food did have a sever hypotension reaction once and reduced lisonpril to compensate feelings of dizziness uneasiness at first but later became more of a euphoric effect feel that prolonged use may cause stomach problems as well as possibly tendon problems sudden feeling of stiffness in joints recommend only using during attacks and getting off it as quick as possible less is better
640|641|UTI Bad headache, ringing in ears, anxiety, depression (I've NEVER had that before!) pain in lower legs - shins, swollen ankles, high b.p., insomnia, weke up at 4 a.m. no matter what time I go to sleep. Lethargic, weak, tired, indigestion. On day 7 it feels like my UTI is coming back. Ribs are sore. Increased appetite (could be because I'm too exhausted to do anything). I HATE THESE PILLS!!!
641|642|Cellulitis in left foot Started with bloat on second pill discontinued after 4 days per dr stopped Jan 29 due to ongoing headache severe bloat also pain in kidneys bowels bladder now severe back muscle issues as of Mar 23..after stopping med realized bloat was muscle spasms around entire trunk of body, both feet and ankles and legs started swelling in March ongoing frequent urination from Jan 25.. I have been to emergency dept 5 times since January..with muscle issues. I was in good health taking no other meds before Keflex now ongoing side effects. I would not recommend this antibiotic to anyone and going forward will always read up on any possible side effects in the future. Have not been able to sleep in my bed since Jan! Hopefully these horrible side effects will stop soon!
642|643|Urinary tract infection Nausea, abnormal pain, my eyes feel heavy and irritated, and extremely bad migraines I've never experienced migraines this bad before Does anybody know what I can use for the migraines I literally took like 5 ibuprofens and it still hasn't went away

644|645|hypertension not many side effects yet other than not sleeping well and dry mouth only on it one week so far the potassium supplement seems to be more of a problem than the lasix but i am afraid to stop it without doctor approval i have had bleeding stomach ulcer this past year and reading the side effects does not make me feel comfortable

646|647|pneumonia Severe seemingly permanent upper arm and shoulder pain I was prescribed this medication during my treatment for leukemia to treat pneumonia - now after 6 years of remission from the leukemia I still have the muscle pain - it affects me daily - unable do do any exercises or work that involves raising my arms above waist high - I can no longer sleep with my arm under my head or pillow - DO NOT TAKE -
647|648|UTI Severe thigh and left knee pain, left hip pain, nightmares I did not like this medicine and will not take it again. I am sitting here with pain in my left leg so bad I want to cry. Then I read the reviews and have been officially freaked out. The pain started in my left knee and seemed to travel upwards to my hip. I have only taken ONE DOSE. I took it about 9 PM and it is now 5 AM and I have barely slept and cannot walk on it.
648|649|Anxiety sedation and diziness i have been in my local hospital for detox 3 times in the last 3 years for a somewhat unique issue i suffer cycles of severe anxiety depression and when i do i use a bit too much of oxycodone to try and quell it it never works and causes me more anxiety so i go to detox so i can go off it and get rest and relaxtion this time the doctor used librium for me at night this is what he gives to the alcoholics and it seems to help them so much i have to say it is the only drug that finally worked and knocked my anxiety right out and allowed me to sleep i suffer from chronic insomnia and this cycle caused me complete terror to go to bed i finally slept like a baby and had no middle of the night waking up in a panic with confusion and depersonaliztion it is way to sedating for me to take regularly as i feel it all day the next day but it may be something i can use for emergency usage when i do not have to do anything the next day cant tell you how glad i am to not suffer from nonstop anxiiety for 10 hours a day that i let go for 80 days straight
649|650|Uti Tightness in my chest, like heart attack, lung congestion (my lungs were completely clear before I started Macrobid), neuropathy, difficulty urinating, numbness in groin and buttocks, inability to pass a bowel movement, lethargy that was incapacitating. It has been two weeks since I finished the prescription, and I am still struggling to get over the lung congestion, tightness in chest, and numbness.
650|651|UTI Nausea, diarrhea, headache, flu-like symptoms. Pain and weakness in hands now. I wish I'd known about this website before I started this! I used to get Bactrim for UTI and had no trouble. This fixed the UTI, but it's not worth the trouble. I'm worried that my hand troubles may be permanent. Shouldn't be prescribed for anyone!
651|652|UTI I was prescribed a 10 day supply but stopped on the 7th day. Reaction began with a severe migraine with light sensitivity. Then my legs began to itch and break out in red welts. As the day progressed I developed extreme fatigue and nausea, dizziness and inability to stay awake. I thought it was the flu until the rash spread over my entire body. The itching was like poison ivy. I felt like I had been poisoned. Called my PCP and he tested me for the flu and it was negative so he said I was having a reaction to the Macrobid. Received a steroid shot and tablets 2 days ago. Feeling a little better but the rash is much worse. It killed the UTI infection and almost killed me! I have no choice but to look at a different med other than Macrobid should I have the need. My body violently rejected this drug. Caution, caution, caution if you decide to use this drug.
652|653|UTI Slow to improve symptoms of UTI but had no side effects while taking. 1 day after discontinuation became itchy, had abdominal pain, then developed angioedema with swelling of face and hands. Broke out in clusters of welts over parts of my body. Benadryl was only minimally effective. Have been started on a short course of Prednisone which is clearing things up nicely. Having read this website I believe that Macrobid's potential for harm outweighs its benefits. Standard drug compendiums state that an allergic reaction to Macrobid is rare. I'm starting to believe otherwise.
653|654|uti The third day of taking this I had experienced hives which was an allergic reaction to the medicine. Also had headache and feel very tired. Had gas as well. Still feeling tired even after being off the medicine for two days now.
654|655|UTI Extreme fatigue; sleepiness throughout the day (almost fell asleep while driving); extreme heartburn; extremely itchy, bumpy rash that moved from place to place all over my body; rash started on arms, then hands, then tops of feet, then neck - front and back, then back, and then back to hands and arms again! This stuff should be banned. It's bad enough experiencing all the side effects, but you have no control over stopping them, because the side effects continue for days even when you've been off the stuff for a week!!
655|656|Uti Within 30 minutes of dose felt this weird tightening/numbness in the bottom half of my face and mouth. Thought nothing of it as it went away in a few hours but came back exactly 30 min after the second dose. I had the same sensation for each subsequent dose I took over the next 7 days. No other side effects but the mouth and face tightening/ numbness was kind of scary. Not sure it helped the UTI as it had somewhat resolved itself by the time I started taking the antibiotic. I took Macrobid to make sure the bacteria is killed so it doesn't progress to a kidney infection or come back. I don't think I would take this drug again as the symptom I experienced was worrisome and I've never had a drug reaction to anything else before.
656|657|UTI None, except a little bit more tired. Cleared up the infection, would take it again!
657|658|UTI Extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, burping I've had horrible experiences with Cipro and Sulfa antibiotics. And almost all antibiotics give me diarrhea and yeast infections. I just took my 6th dose of macrobid and I'm not having any of the normal side effects, or any serious ones. I also have a cold, so the fatigue could be due to that. Macrobid took the burning away and didn't give me the shits or panic attacks. That's a good antibiotic.
658|659|severe uti horrendous coughing every night for over a week now to the point i feel like i have cracked all my ribs because i am coughing so hard i stopped taking them 3 days ago but the cough hasnt eased and now i am itching all over especially my feet it has cleared the uti but i would rather get up 5 times a night for the toilet than experience the side effects of this drug should not be prescribed nan

682|683|SpasmsContractions-NervePain-Damage Vertigo, not for hypotension patience, vomiting, nausea, stoned, drunken spins, severe constipation, Fainting, tachycardia, no nerve pain, no severe spasms, my completely unmanageable pain is gone. I halved my pills same side effects- symptoms. I am trying a fourth now and will see if that works. It's been 30 minutes feel high and it also give anxiety. Hopefully I can adjust as my options for meds are so limited. DO not suggest anyone with low blood pressure take this. I had to puke and put on compression stockings as well as take other BP meds to raise my BP and stop the spins then passed out for 12 hours. At a full dose I worry that I could be in a coma. Couldn't imagine anyone wanting to abuse this as the side effects are awful enough. Dehydration and headaches also occur. I am hoping this is an adjustment period but will be calling my doctor asap as he suggested. I do not suggest taking with any other sedative/ pain medicine/ almost went to the ER... I do feel out breath a little at a fourth dose. (this is jst 1/4th of a 350mg pill) Please be careful with this drug. I love reality too so only hope to take this as a last resort if I don't stop all together because I feel completely like I smoked pot in space and not connected with the world around me and not in a good way. I ate with this dose and have been drinking glasses of water. Taking midodrine to raise BP.

I lost all skin on my hands, numb at the tips, sharp electric shock feeling when I touch things. Side affects got worse following each treatment. Lost toe nails after second treatment and big toes hurt, finger nails are now purple and they say the finger nails will probably fall off too. The pain is intolerable at times, especially at night. After a few weeks it has gotten a little easier to walk, hands are arthritic feeling, ankles hurt - I just hurt all over and I feel 90 years old instead of my usual active and happy self. Not sure if it was worth it yet as I had chemo first, with surgery to follow. I cherish my quality of life over length and this is far more severe side affects than I was told to expect with only 4 treatments. They gave me pain meds the first few weeks, but now suggest the symptoms should be subsiding and I should use natural remedies and buck up and it will go away in Chemo is poison for some and medicine for others and doctors are not sure how anyone will react for sure. More research is needed to find a cure, but in the meantime more emphasis should be spent on treating the side effects and not just the cancer. Side affects are real and most often pushed off onto the aides and nurses to treat and unless you get a really qualified nurse, this can be emotionally and physically very difficult.

686|687|Trigeminal Neuropathy Mental imbalance Confusion Desperate and disturbing thoughts I was given this drug as treatment for a neuropathic condition. I was warned by the doctor there may be issues, but that I would know pretty quickly whether or not the drug was suited for me. Yes, that was correct! On the 2nd dose, I could tell something felt different in my brain. I was processing things differently --and distant (not so good) memories were coming back in a rush, as if they had just occurred. By day 4 when thoughts of suicide raced through my mind, thankfully I was still lucid enough to know it was the drug and I had to stop taking it.

It's Monday and I couldn't even work from home. It's like my brain was sleeping. I gave up and slept for 2 hours after a full 8 hours of sleep the night before. I am normally a high energy person so I thought I was losing my mind until I realized the only change is I started Zyrtec last week and was told by the pharmacist for best results take it daily. He said for best results take it everyday whether you're experiencing symptoms or not. When I woke up I decided to Google Zyrtec side effects and it wasn't until I found these consumer comments that I know to quit taking Zyrtec!!!!!

We stopped taking it immediately and now, it's been 3 days since we stopped and it has gotten 10 times worse! The hives on her thighs are very severe and I'm hoping it doesn't spread anywhere else.

My side effects were listed as happening in 2% of people in Lopid studies. My reaction onset quickly (within 3 days), and after quitting gemfibrozil/Lopid, I started feeling better within days. I was re-prescribed Tricor, which is in the same class as Lopid. I had similar effects with it. So this family of drugs didn't work for me. I was given 1200mg (2x 600mg tabs) Lopid per day. I was only taking over the counter Claritin for allergies while on Lopid.

726|727|For a bacterial infection Severe rash. My son was prescribed bactrim for a bacterial infection on his face. On day 10 he broke out in a rash on his entire body. We discontinued use and he is now taking benadryl and two topical creams to clear it up. It has gotten worse instead of better. Hoping this is the last of it. We are going back to the doctor today. He's itchy and just uncomfortable. This was a crummy way to find out he is allergic to sulfa (found in bactrim).
727|728|sinus infection I experienced a persistent headache from day one. My sleep has been terrible. My neck is stiff and hurts.By the end of day 8 I discovered swollen hard glands on the back of my head and neck. They are quite painful. I would not take it again. Apparently it has a lot of terrible side effects which are probably not worth the risk unless whatever you are taking it for in the first place could kill you.
728|729|Follicletitis I took one pill twice a day as labeled. After my 2nd pill, I had severe stomach pains. I felt as if my spine was going to burn through my skin. Also my upper GI was as if I still had my gallbladder. Totally painful. I was dizzy and had flu like symptoms which included persistent vomiting. Didn't finish my meds and currently waiting on different medication. If you have the slightest stomach pains, I don't suggest pepto bismal. Go to the ER.
729|730|MRSA(staph)Infection Muscle pain, stomach cramps, swollen tongue, anxiety, feel like I was hit in the head with a brick, dizziness like living outside your body, nausea, tiredness. Feelings like you would rather be dead than taking it. Cured the staph, but after you finish taking it the after effects are worse than the side effects. I think it's altered my brain and vision! Feel worse off it than when I took it. An awful, awful drug, but it did help the infection, just not sure if I could go through taking it again but sometimes there is nothing else.
730|731|Ibs and colitis Made me happy and sleepy It's a wonder drug. Helped with all my stomach pain and those pesky poops all the time!!!
731|732|sinus infection Within the first few days of taking the medication I had some small bumps (what I now know were hives) on my lower scalp. I did not realize that I was having a small allergic reaction to the medicine when I noticed these so I continued taking cefzil. I had skipped a few doses by accident and when I finished taking the medicine my lip had a huge hive on it and so did my right arm. I took my prescribed allegra and they went away within a few hours. Later that night it returned and I had hives all over my body. Less than a day and a half later the hives merged into huge patches covering my whole back, stomach, chest and neck. They also covered my whole scalp and spots on my face. My eyes became extremely puffy and then my lips became so swollen they were numb. The doc recommended benadryl and allegra. I took it and a few days later the hives subsided but my hands and feet became swollen and itchy which later subsided. If you feel anything unusual happening when you take this medicine stop taking it IMMEDIATELY. This allergic reaction was the most horrible thing I have ever experienced.
732|733|Dog bites , to prevent infection Only side effect I have noticed so far is extreme tiredness! It is very apparent, where I will feel fine and then take Cefzil, and and 20-30 min later I can barely keep my eyes open. Its harder to wake up in the morning too, since I started this. Only day 5 today, hope my symptoms don't get worse like most of you are saying!!! Plus I am allergic to penicillin and I know this is in the same family, so, we will see. Bites are healing with no infection and feel fine other than being so tired after taking.
733|734|Diverticulitis (recurrent) each time i have been prescribed the combination of cipro and flagyl i have experienced progressively more severe side effects the first few days are not so bad however the longer on the combo the worse the symptoms which are extreme cramping on a par with labor pains bloating inflammation of the whole lower abdominal region feeling as though my colon received a caustic burn itching in my ears fatigue and mental confusion i have told my doctor every time she wants to prescribe it but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears apparently it s the preferred treatment i am not one to exaggerate and maybe her other patients do this drug combination made me feel as though my colon was going to rupture and i would die i could hardly walk i felt as though i was carrying 9 lb bowling ball in my pelvis my uterus felt like it was being expelled through my vagina due to the pelvic pressure my bladder felt battered and i had to urinate every 20 mins to an hour because i couldn t stan plain and simple i believe this to be poison will never take it again like others i have also suffered knee problems plantar faciatis and tinnitus that i now wonder if it was the result of taking this medication

737|738|Sinus Infection Anxiety, Stomach upset I found that this medication made me quite anxious. I would wake up at 4:00 am every morning while taking this medications and then once I stopped, I slept fine. I also found that if I didn't take this with a large glass of water or if I lay down after taking the medication, I would have an upset stomach. Although it did clear up my sinus infection, there is no reason to sleep only a few hours each night when there are other antibiotics available with less severe side effects.

But the stomach cramps were pretty bad all through the day and more noticeable in the night. On day 4 and resorted to googling symptoms as the stomach cramps and bloating was a lot worse plus loose stools. Would not recommend this drug ask for an alternative!! I got given them after a course of penicillin failed but I would rather take a higher dose of that, did not realise!

754|755|Diverticulitis Major brain fog, pain in my upper back and shoulders, severe neck pain, dizziness, unstable, feeling like I'm having an outer body experience, bad taste in my mouth, pounding head and headaches. I currently am scheduled for a colon resection surgery on December 13th but last week started having another flare up with my diverticulitis. My GI doctor called in Flagyl and Cipro, after me already telling them I HATED this medicine! But, being scared that my surgery could be postponed, I reluctantly began taking this dreadful excuse for an antibiotic once again. There ARE other alternatives to Flagyl and do not let doctors tell you differently. Until doctors are on this for a full course of treatment, they won't understand how horrible this drug truly is! It's demonic!!! Feel free to contact me at lynn.gaston@hotmail.com

759|760|C diff I first took the medicine for c diff and an entirely infected colon I had anxiety attacks severely, sure I was going to die headache, and yellow tongue for 6 months this was in 2013 but it did get rid of the c diff. I just recently was on an antibiotic a chest infection after off of the antibiotic I had symptoms of c diff again so they put me back on it. The anxiety was much worse , I was once again sure I was going to die my tongue is already yellow after 3 days so I was sure it was going to swell up. The c diff test was negative do I am not taking it as of now. I am glad to have found this site because I felt a little crazy and I see many others have similar problems

Constant headache, always tired... horrible drug. Don't recommend it.
786|787|Depression The side effects I mention here are INITIAL side effects. There is a major difference between initial side effects and regular ones. I have two major initial side effects: 1 the depression gets deeper, 2 I get very afraid and anxious. These both effects almost incapacate me completely. My doctor says I have to ride it out until it works. But I don't know if I can bear it any longer. For the fear I take Oxaxepam. I know this is a dangerous drug in the long run. Two years ago I was addicted to it, als because of initial side effects. (of Prozac) Now, I was using Lexapro for two years and it was working very good, so I thought it was time to stop it. This was a BIG MISTAKE. Because of that I am now in a hell-situation where I don't know what to do anymore. Every evening I say to myself, tomorrow I will go to work for half a day. And everytime I do not manage because of the fear and the drowsiness of the Oxaxepam. I do not have enough help. Is there anybody out there who has any good advi So Lexapro helped me very good foor two years. Only I almost can not stand the initial side effects. Also, quitting with Lexapro is in my case basically not an option. When it works, it works very good for me. Also, I have read a professional paper about Lexapro and it is one of the best and prove antidepressants

Finished last pill on the 10th. The following day, my shins began to itch while at work and began having severe chest pain ( thought I was dissecting my aorta). That evening, severe itching and rash covered my body=hives , edema began to show on my right eyelid &amp; upper lip . Took benadryl and went to bed. This morning, I awoke with severe angioedema, honestly, just happy I woke up. Notified my prescribing MD and Medical care received today, IM Solumedrol 125mg received and po prednisone 40 mg prescribed, to take with benadryl and zyrtec. I was unaware how long this medication stays in the body and thankful I sought treatment.
788|789|UTI None No side effects but the drug didn't work!
789|790|UTI After taking macro for almost a week, I developed what I thought was the start of a stomach virus. Fatigue, nausea, stomach cramps. By the next day I was so nauseous I was afraid to leave the bathroom due to the loose bowels and extreme nausea. I was sent home from work because I was pale, sweating, and had vomited. I went home and spent the day running to the bathroom. The next morning I woke up to a red, raised patterned rash down my thighs to my shins. I was very dizzy and nauseous. Contacted dr who prescribed and was advised to stop the Macrobid, which I did immediately. After stopping the prescription I had one calm day and am now back to the extreme nausea, stomach cramps, flu like symptoms. No appetite at all, water is barely tolerable. I will never take Macrobid again, not allow my child to be given it.

856|857|Migraines Tension headaches Cluster The first night I took this I had tingling in my lips and since then the tingling, which has been mild, is diffuse and likes to roam. Last night it was all over but originated from my hips and butt! It was weird but not painful or particularly distracting. I have fibromyalgia &amp; CFS, so I have headaches daily and my migraine triggers have increased, so I started this med because I really needed relief from the constant pain in my head, it was a quality of life thing. I have had word recall issues but I already get that with the fibro fog so it's not unfamiliar and I've learned how to deal. Ive lost about 5lbs and food does not appeal to me. I already had a lot of fatigue and haven't noticed an increase. I am sleeping better, which is really awesome. I am feeling more level emotionally but when I get overwhelmed (which I attribute to the fibro, it's a CNS thing) I'm quicker to snap. I haven't noticed any lack of sexual desire, thank god, so many of the meds I've tried made me dead inside and that's a deal breaker. A little tingling and numbness is no biggie considering the chronic pain I'm already in, I did get a moment of pins and needles, but I was sitting funny and I repositioned and it eventually went away. The weight loss is an added perk since I gained 25lbs back in 2011 on lyrica and haven't been able to lose it, like it totally killed my metabolism. I haven't had any weird thoughts like I did with the lyrica or cymbalta, which both caused psychotic breaks and suicidial ideation. I've had one migraine on the day I got my menses and it wasn't as bad as it could've been and I've had one tension headache since beginning this med &amp; I took the fioricet to calm it down. I am considering trirating up to 50mg daily to see if I can't get rid of the hormonal migraines altogether, but I don't want to mess up a good thing. So many people seem to have such bad reactions on this med and for once, I'm not one of them! I will update in a few months, but right now I am very happy with this med and how it's helping me function a little better
857|858|erectile dysfunction Bad headache and stuffy nose Only took half of pill. Started taking afrin for nasal congestion worked great and also seemed to lessen headaches.
858|859|PMDD Breasts swelled an entire cup size in a WEEK and were extremely tender. Ravenous hunger, spotty period The hunger began when I started Yaz. I discontinued 10 days later because of the hunger, and I am STILL feeling the effects! It has now been three weeks since I have been off of it, and the side effects are still here. My breast size is still a full cup size larger. I hate this med!!!! Never going on oral contraceptives again.

860|861|H. Pylori Neuropathy in head, legs, hands, insomnia, nausea, stomach pain, head and body twitching, zapping in the head, weakness in the legs, high heart rate, vision loss. I took this medication for 11 days to treat H. Pylori bacteria. I suppose to take it for 14 days but on the 11th day I thought I am gonna die. I woke up with severe nerve pain running down my right leg and my calf swelled up and started burning. That is when I stopped taking this medication. When I was on it, I had severe stomach pain, nausea, leg weakness, and tingling toes. Soon after I finished this medication, my head and face went numb and I lost visual acuity in my left eye. I also had bad insomnia and head twitching an muscle twitching. Gradually, I developed neuropathy in my feet, legs, and arms. Ive seen a neurologist for my symptoms and she denies that the metronidazole can cause such an adverse reaction, but I know that I never had neurological issues before taking this horrid medication. Its been more then 8 months since I finished the course and I am trying to recover. It been very slow recovery with ups and downs and I hope that the time and God will heal me. If you suffered similar symptoms, please share with me your story. My email is: gvpena@yahoo.com

870|871|"Mood Stabilzer/Possible Weight Loss The first three days I took only one pill a day at 25 mgs. It was ok. I felt a little ""flat"" but not in a bad way. The fourth day I went up to two pills a day as recommended by the shrink. It was alright although I began to feel brain dead at work. Speaking my own language was a challenge at times, food was tasting weird, I could barely keep my eyes open at my desk. This past Saturday I slept about 18 hours straight. Today, two days later, my skull feels like a metal helmet, I had waves of nausea all day long but couldn't eat anything all day to throw up. I considered going to the Emergency room but I didn't think they could do anything for me.The shrink told me to cut back by one pill but I just want to go cold turkey. I want this stuff out of my body. What a mistake! The Prozac was fine. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!! I have been on Prozac for 20 years. I wanted to discuss possibly reducing my prescription but the psychiatrist thought to supplement with Topamax? I will admit the possibility of losing weight did lure me in even though I would be more medicated. I would rather be my chubby funny self than a nauseous zombie. Stay away from this crap."

880|881|"Depression loss of libido.....constant brain fog......memory loss I have been on Effexor XR about 14 years. After trying Paxil and Prozac and experiencing complete mental meltdowns after about one year of use. (My Doctor told me they sometimes just ""quit"" working) He advised me to take Effexor XR. I got my life back and became the person I was meant to be. I felt happy and content. The drug has continued to help me all these years even though I have memory problems, brain fog and loss of libido. I think it is a small price to pay for living well. That being said: I recently got mixed up on my meds and missed taking Effexor XR for 5 days. I fell into the pit of hell. The side effects were frightening. I was sure I was going to die, thought I had a brain tumor. I experienced: loud ear ringing, what felt like brain surges, confusion, unsteady gait, dizziness, nausea, and uncontrollable rage. I will take this medication for the rest of my life and will never miss another dose."

I used the brand Cravit (Levofloxacin). it is the Japanese brand from the company that first created the drug. I had very little side affects. I did take it at same times every day with heaps of food (full meal, yoghurt and Yakult) morning and night. It worked for me. I was very weary if taking it as I have had a bad experience with Flagyl so understand what most folks have gone through with this drug. I would strongly recommend getting hold of the Japanese brand Cravit. worked for me.

After the 3rd season, taking this stuff.. I had an Anxiety attack.. and then thought I was like disconnected from my body for a while. I didn't know what it was. I thought I was having a Heart attack. I'm not normally a dramatic person.. but it freaked me out, so I went to the Doctor. He said I'm in perfect health.. and then asked me if I was on anything. Only the Zyrtec. He said, in some rare cases, people can have my symptoms and to stay away from it. I haven't touched it since then and I'm back to normal. Weird. I just thought somebody should know, just in case it happens to them.

Although I took it at night, I felt so dizzy in the day that I was afraid to drive. I had no energy, just wanted to sit, which is totally the opposite of who I am. Never laughed, cried, no emotions. My eyes hurt, my vision was blurred. I would wake up in the night drenched in sweat. In the morning I was exhausted and would have diarrhea. My mouth was dry and I had no appetite. Just went off it yesterday. The doctor wanted me to continue with a different drug but I want NO part of it. I would think long and hard before starting this drug.

924|925|BPH Initially on 5 mg/day. Strong headache and back pain. Stopped it for 4 days. Started again but this time with 2.5 mg/day. The first three days some headache and some pain in the legs. In this second round (2.5 mg/day) pain was much less than the first time that I was taking 5 mg/day. After 15 days now I have no pain and everything seems ok. I also have to mention that this time I take the medicine early in the morning with breakfast. Is working on the BPH symptoms so far. I think the body should adjust to the medicine before one can take a high dose.

931|932|seasonal allergies Bad stiff neck. Continual dull forehead headache. Fatigue and just not feeling myself. I started taking zyrtec at night for my allergies thinking it would help with nighttime congestion and sleep. Woke up very tired first. After a couple of days started getting a dull headache, I seldom get headaches unless extremely congested. Then started having a stiff neck which worsen over a couple of days. In good health ans active other than allergies. I was planning to go to doctor and spouse suggested only thing I was doing different was taking zyrtec, so I stopped. After 3 days off starting to feel better. Stiff neck gone and headache less severe. Waiting to see if in a few days if all symptoms go away. My symptoms started only after taking this medicine. After reading others remarks I did have one day with some hives on my legs but dismissed it because I was playing golf and thought it was alot of bug bites. Never had adverse reactions to Claritin or flonase like this. Going back to them. These reactions should be also noted on product. And doctors should be wary of suggesting this medicine.

934|935|Mild lesions It is a horribly painful and uncomfortable method of resurfacing the skin. Next time I'll just have it lasered. I've used Efudex before to remove minor skin lesions caused by too much sunlight exposure. It's like paint stripper, first it removes at least three layers of skin and the treated area goes bright red. I use cosmetic camouflage to hide it because it is so unsightly. The treatment is generally prescribed for 21-30 days, most people stop after 14 days because it is so painful. Fever blisters appear around the mouth the skin feels as though it's had class rubbed into it and for those sensitive to this stuff you will feel very ill indeed. I'm 17 days into treatment with another 4 days to go. I've reduced application to once per day because I feel so ill. With a compromised immune system I've developed a hacking cough, vomiting, temperature and I've been in bed for the last two days. I'll never use efudex again. Yes it works, but the pain is too great to justify the results. There must be a better way of removing AKs without going through such AGONY.

937|938|Chronic Migraine Feeling more calm, slightly harder to do cardio workout, vivid funny dreams - overall negligible! I have not had a headache for 1 week straight. This is a miracle as I am used to 2 or 3 per week. I even enjoyed a glass of RED wine and was fine. WOW that is like a another miracle. Sleep has been fine as long as I stay on my regular schedule, which is what I find to be key to anybody's good night's sleep. As per the weight gain, I have not had any. As a fitness nutritionist and fitness instructor I believe that if you eat calories according to your BMR and work out regularly including cardio 3-4 times a week you should not have too many problems with weight gain, no matter what drug your on. If you are still gaining weight drop the calories! We will see how the long term effects are of Inderal LD 80mg (generic), but so far it has given me a better quality of life.

961|962|Father dementia His dementia worsened dramatically during the month he was on it. Hostile, combative, wandering - these symptoms did not start till on this drug. Had to take him to ER and they took him off right away. But the damage is done. My father was soooo much better on no medication, except his blood pressure drugs. Start giving these type drugs and you will wish you hadn't.
962|963|Severe Night Sweating the main side effect i experienced was sleepiness produced a cloudy feeling in the morning making it extemely difficult to wake up easily slept very deeply for 10 14 hours a night it definately worked to ease my night sweats i never wake up needing to change my clothes or the sheets anymore ever i d also give it a rating of 5 as a sleeping pill
963|964|weight loss I did not experience any side effects The medication did nothing to change my appetite or my energy level. In short, it did not work
964|965|IBS Dry mouth, but sipping liquids throughout the day helps enormously. Every month I would have an attack that caused excruciating cramps and pain. Sometimes the pain was so bad that I would have to go the ER. After an attack, my entire abdomen would feel so bruised that I could not stand up straight for two or three days. Levsin SL did nothing to help. My doctor recently switched me to Bentyl. So far it has been a miracle drug. While I still have cramping when gas passes through my intestines, it is very minimal.
965|966|osteoporosis Flu like by evening after taking the one tablet. After 2 days real bone pain could only walk by holding on to things. Felt total fatigue. I was off work for 2 weeks. Its 28 days now back in bed again with pain and fatigue and unable to work. I was in good health till taking this one pill. Yes I have osteoporosis but this drug is running my life. I only hope it will finally clear my system. Do not take it. I have found a safe alternative after doing research. Doctors sadly just think this causes gastrointestinal upset. I wish mine was shocked. Never knew about these side effects.
966|967|BP &amp; ectopics Foggy/dizzy head on 3rd day, muscle aches, short of breath, stomach/gi issues, tiredness Did nothing for my BP dropped my resting rate from 60 to 50 which left me incapable of doing basically anything. Increased the amount of missed beats I felt and gave me anxiety and a shakiness I have never experienced before. Probably the worst drug I have ever taken and all this on 1.25mg a day!

972|973|5 Scoliosis surgeries, Anxiety,etc. Arms/legs felt like they were on fire. Cold sweats. Sleepless restless nights. Anxiety got worse. Paranoia. Crazy dreams. Vomiting. Worsened back pain. Headaches. Blurry vision. Constant yawning with gagging. Lack of appetite. Jitters and twitches. Shivering when not cold. Sensitivity to light. Worsened depression. Everything tasted weird like chemicals. Electricity/tingly feeling in hands and feet. Eyes felt like someone was holding them open, pupils super dilated. Uncomfortable feeling overall in my own skin, couldn't move without the pain all over my body worsening... I have had 5 Scoliosis surgeries in the past 8 years, the last two were this April 2015, in the same week, Emergency surgeries, I had rods (hardware) in my back, one of the screws got loose and moved into my spinal canal pinching my spinal cord. I almost ended up paralyzed, or like my surgeon said, I could have died if it cut my spinal cord. Throughout my surgeries they have removed 3 rib bones and a piece of my hip bone to fuse my spine. Through the everyday pain and struggle, I have suffered through severe depression, anxiety, and lots of pain. My doctor thought, let's try a medication that deals with all 3 of those things. So she prescribed Cymbalta... I had high hopes,since she seemed like it was such an amazing medication that I'd probably end up all smiles, lollipops and kittens with the sun shining out of my ass... Nope, a whole lot of nope, I went Through hell with this medication, I thought I was dying, it puts you through the worst hell imaginable, I kept wishing i could just rush myself to the hospital and flush it all out of my system. It made everything worse, I could not Function, I would never recommend Cymbalta to anyone unless you have a death wish... Good luck to anyone about to take it,I know a lot of people's systems are different. I saw more negative outcomes on this medication on this page than i saw any good feedback. I ignored all the negative posts... Big mistake, because now I'm one of those that has to add to them...
973|974|Depression &amp; Anxiety, Joint Pain Very Tired, the feeling of just Not wanting to do anything at all,just feeling BLA and the insane feeling of being so HOT on and off all day it's crazy it's freezing outside and I'm out there in a tank top my neighbors probley think I'm nuts..Did NOT help with my joint pain actually I feel worse I know every medication effects people differently but this definitely isn't for me.. Hopefully it works for someone else.. Good luck.. Definitely would not recommend it.. Sucks didn't help at ALL..

999|1000|taking it for depression, agression I had uncontrollable movements from head to toe. Very bad headache and stiff all over. Jaw and mouth movements with extreme rigidness and stiffness. Pain. Unable to sleep at all. Drooling excessively. Did I mention my muscles were so tight that they started hurting really bad. Still get mild flashbacks of symptoms 4 months later after stopping the medicine, Thank God. I will never take this medicine again. I've learned my lesson about this medicine and I have learned that doctors and nurses will not tell you what medicine they are giving you, they just give it to you. Just to say I took this medicine a while ago and had these horrible side effects when I was 18 years old and I'm 30 years old now. Had to go to the hospital for depression not too long ago and they just injected me with this crap without telling me what it was and once again the horrible, painful, sleepless, side effects. From now on I am asking what every medicine is the doctors or nurse try to give me and if they say that it is Haldol, I am gonna snap and tell them to take it and see how wonderful the sleepless, stiff pain is from this horrible awful medicine is. I felt like I was almost dead when I took this crap. Feel like a stiff dead person or something. Just awful, awful medicine. Do not take this medicine people. It's not worth the bad risks that come along with it. Plus this medicine did not do one bit of good for me, just stiffness, pain, and uncontrollable odd movements in my whole muscular system and very painful. Had many a sleepless nights before I found out it was this medicine doing these bad feelings in my body. All I know is I was so relieved when I found out it was this medicine doing these bad things to me I wanted to jump for joy. I really thought something serious was wrong with my body and it would never be cured but thankfully it went away when I stopp

1011|1012|anxiety and agitation Feeling sedated, Headache, dizziness My doctor prescribed Lexapro after trying Zoloft. I must honestly say that after a month I already feel great. Before Lexapro, I I found myself getting agitated over any little thing, and getting mad easily. I also cried a lot when I was mad. After a month, I already foud myself in situations where I would normally react, but instead I have a calm reaction, and things just don't bother me like they use to. I hear of all the horrible withdraw affects, but I don't see myself coming off anytime soon. I am more focused, happy , and relaxed. All medications have some type of side effects Most of mine passed, except I do feel more laid back and not rushed. I am happy on Lexapro 5mg
1012|1013|fibroids PERMANENT INJURY, not side effect. ONE shot of Lupron destroyed my abdominal wall and I have not recovered, even after two major abdominal wall reconstruction surgeries. Do NOT try Lupron. Lupron is known as the Russian Roulette drug. Lupron is NOT FDA-approved for IVF. Lupron does NOT cure endometriosis. You may get some temporary pain relief for endo but Lupron causes permanent bone pain and other injuries. Lupron does NOT help you to get pregnant. Lupron shuts down your ovaries. Lupron does not cause a temporary state of menopause; it actually lowers your estrogen level to zero as if you were 100 years old. You will suffer the injuries of an elderly person. Google Lupron Petition.

1018|1019|"Post knee replacement surgery Caused pretty significant constipation, but stool softener helped a lot. After knee replacement surgery, the hospital gave me Norco and it didn't touch the pain. Dilaudid didn't touch the pain. So they moved on to a combo of Opana and Opana ER--This combo was excellent for pain relief and did not make me feel ""high"" or out of it. Was able to stay in the 3ish range of pain with the meds, which is a huge win."

1034|1035|acne, even skin tone AMAZING, minor symptoms if you follow the regimen described in additional commentsThis really should help a lot. I hope it does because I know i read reviews a lot and I was so nervous about starting. I really hope someone tries this step by step. Here is some other tips if you really wanna clear you skin and you are serious about doing anything in your power. These have made my skin glow and perfect 1. Drink:2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in half a cup of water. You can read online the amazing benefits for acne and just your health in general Supplement: instead of taking so many medications for acne that are damaging your skin and overdosing it with chemicals I advice natural vitamins that help the skin. Tumeric pills morning and night and Spirulina are amazing for acne and your body's health! You can also read their benefits online. MORNING: 1. use quarter size of jojoba oil and massage into the skin for 30 seconds this will soften peeling and combat dryness, jojoba oil is also great for scars and acne in general. Hop into shower with jojoba oil on if you take a shower in the morning 2. Wash with water, there will be a film of jojoba oil still on skin. At this point add your gentle cleanser and massage for another 30 seconds to wash away the oil. If if still remains you can GENTLY massage with a washcloth. This should wash away the jojoba oil 3. Apply a thick layer of moisturizer and let it soak in before applying any makeup NIGHT 1. Same as morning #1 with jojoba oil. Hop into the shower with jojoba oil still on if you take a shower at night 2. Apply gentle cleanser and massage very gently with washcloth or cleansing cloth to remove dirt and dry flaking skin. DO NOT BE ROUGH. Do this for 30 seconds and rise with warm water 3. dry face and wait 5 minutes and apply a pea size amount of tazorac to problem areas!! not areas that are completely fine because that will just irritate them for no reason. After applying tazorac wait 1 minute for it to sink in and then apply a thick moisturizer. Keep applying till the skin feels calm and not cracked and dry 4. Get a lot of sleep and drink a lot!
1035|1036|"Hypertension None so far, that my previous BP med (Norvasc) didn't cause -- mainly tinnitus and cold feet/sensitivity to cold weather. I wanted a change from Norvasc -- I took it for 2 years for my genetic high blood pressure. I also have a neurological disease, and it was -- perhaps interacting with my other meds -- causing me many side effects, like extra unsteadiness, dry mouth, etc. I also take Cozaar (losartin), 100 mg with my 25 mg of atenolol. (I must take the Merck brand-name Cozaar due to coughing caused by generics.) Few people who find negative side effects of this drug mention their weight...mine is normal for my 5'11"" height: 172 pounds. That seems to really help the most. Although my high BP is genetic, and can't help that, keeping weight low really helps...you must decide between feeling better or eating as much as you like. I love to eat, and I eat everything I like, just watch portions. Exercise is limited for me due to my balance trouble -- I'm in a wheelchair. ""Preaching"" finished!"

I am on topomax because I was recently diagnosed with a mood disorder, similar to bipolar but not. It calms me, and keeps me stabilized to the point where I am feeling like I am not fighting a war inside my head. I would rather deal with the side effects then my mood disorder, that is for sure!

So that's not too bad but the med's have been making me extremely moody and irritable which aren't good at all. I can't be around too much talking or I get annoyed easily and just want everyone to go away. Besides that they've been giving me extreme headaches(even though the doctors said they were headache medications too). But the main thing I am focused on is the pain. For the past two weeks it hasn't been nearly as easy to breath, if I had to guess what it's like to have asthma, this would be it. I have a constant cough when I breath and If I work too hard at work my breathing turns into heaving. My muscles feel like they barely work at all. And there is a sharp shooting pain in my upper abdomen area. I'm not 100% sure if these are things that will fade out in time or not, again I've only been on the medicine for a month.

1049|1050|Alzheimers My mum aged 94 was diagnosed with alzheimers in 2007 and was given aricept even though both she and I were not happy about the drug as we had watched a tv programme about its negative effects on patients she took it for approximately five weeks and her personality changed for the worse she became aggressive and afraid to leave the house and got very upset at the day centre which was completely out of character for her. Mum stopped taking the aricept after 5 weeks and returned to the way she was before taking it.I am very concerned about the side effects of this drug but some of my relations want Mum to go back to taking it so I am immensely grateful to the contributers of this site for highlighting so many of the negative effects of aricept. Mum is now 97 and seems no worse than when she was first diagnosed back in 2007 and I feel sure is alive and well today thanks to stopping taking aricept before it did lasting damage. She has been taking a homeopathic remedy (lycopodium)for the past two years which seems to have stopped her condition from getting any worse.

1059|1060|Acne, prescribed by dermatologist Peeling, itching, iritation, more breakouts, darkening of spots I've been using Tazorac for about a month and a half and I am getting a little discouraged. For a while, about three weeks in, I noticed that things seemed to be improving, but then I'd have phases of more breakouts. Right now I'm in one of those breakout phases that seems to be worse than before. So bad in fact that I actually made the decision to go on Proactive to see if that would work faster/better. I changed my mind after reading that I still may go through some of the same side effects as Tazorac. After reading everyone's comments on this forum, I've decided to stick with Taz for at least another three weeks, which is when I go back to the dermatologist to let her check my progress. This whole process is definitely about being patient, even though I'm very self-conscious about my appearance right now and want something to fix it all NOW. I hope that Tazorac is worth the wait and stress. Besides, Taz is more cost effective than Proactive and that's a very good thing. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories. You've helped me a lot.
1060|1061|"Memory loss I'm writing this for my 90 year old mother. She has suffered severe anxiety (sense of ""doom""), loss of appetite, very weak, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleeping a lot, muscle ache, stomach soreness. My mother was given Aricept while in a rehab center after a fall and leg fracture. Mom always has these episodes when in hospitals, etc., of not knowing where she is, getting upset, etc. but always recovers when back home. Don't know why dr. felt she needed this. Was ""ok"" on 5 mg in rehab ctr but when she got home 3 weeks ago dr. upped it to 10 mg. She started with MAJOR anxiety (woke up during middle of night with fear and shaking). I took it in my own hands and cut her down to 5 mg. 3 days ago. Anxiety stopped immediately! BUT...she is still very weak and short of breath and fills up after eating practically nothing! After reading here how others are also suffering same things, I think she needs to be OFF it NOW! Starting tomorrow we'll be stopping it and getting Mom back to herself! I hope it's not too late. This is a NASTY drug!!!"

Go to an integrative Dr. and let her/him steer you the right way with healthy alternatives. This is my next move. No more in the box Dr.s that know very little about diet, nutrition and supplements.

1080|1081|Grandmother, Dementia Extreme change in mood and behavior, worsening symptoms of Dementia, restless insomnia, hallucinations, weakness, fatigue This drug is not for everyone. As caregivers for my 88 year old grandmother with Dementia, the past 2 months have been an absolute nightmare for my mother and I. Grandmother was initially on 5mg/day and two weeks ago the dosage was increased to 10 mg/day. Within a week of taking 5mg/day, she began exhibiting a sharp mental and emotional decline. Within 3 days of switching to 10mg daily, my grandmother's Dementia started to become much, much worse and only worsened over time (she has been on 10mg for 2 weeks). Examples: Swearing (which she has never, ever done in my lifetime), combativeness, refusing vital meds, hallucinations (sounds, events, visual), crying, anger, mood swings, physical hostility, extreme fluctuations in body temperature, extreme insomnia (averaging 3 hours each night), roaming the house all night &amp; talking incoherently as she walks, agitation, excessive rapid talking (for hours at a time to imaginary people), speaking incoherently and forgetting who family members are. I cannot understate how hellish this has been for all of us. We are reducing her dosage back to 5mg daily and then we will be taking her OFF OF THIS MEDICATION. Her symptoms and behavior were nothing like this before she began taking Aricept. The timing of her decline correlates to when she began taking the Aricept and the subsequent increase in dosage.

1083|1084|Osteoporosis I took my first Boniva. I had the worst cough, hoarse voice, upper respiratory issues! I went into my doctor a week later and she gave me an inhaler, antibiotics, cough medicine, etc. I went back into the doctor a week later and she gave me a steroid inhaler, to try with the inhaler and more medicine. My voice was hoarse since then. The cough has been awful. I was diagnosed with bronchitis and pneumonia. I quit coughing about three weeks into this whole thing but my voice was still hoarse.. My doctor encouraged me to take one more dose and see how I did. After four weeks of coughing, my cough was a very low level, and then I took another pill, and the cough returned within two days and my voice is very hoarse! I have been sick since I started taking this, and thats only after the second dose but Ive been sick since the first day I took it! I am about one week in from taking my second dose. My husband said thats my last dose! I ache all over I thought it was from coughing until I found this site and read these comments. My shoulder is killing me, my lower back is killing me! I thought it was from the coughing so much, now I kind of wonder! I am speaking this into my iPad, after using my inhaler and coughing through this writing here. Im wondering if an infusion will just make me feel more rotten for six months? Curious if anybody experienced that?
1084|1085|PCOS i get nausea almost every time i take it for about an hour and I have vomited a few times. It leaves a metal taste in my mouth for a few hours. Loss of appetite and weight loss. The smell and taste right when i take the injection bothers me. It's hard to deal with at times, and i resent the fact that im 18 and have to do this but it could be worse because It definitely beats Metformin. I can tell when i don't eat right. I'm definitely getting used to what it does to my body. It's nothing i can't live with. It's been the best medicine i've tried for my PCOS (and i've tried metformin, glumetza, and actos) even though i get sick 8 out of 10 times i take it, over all im happy with it.
1085|1086|High blood pressure Chest pain - left arm pain -jaw pain- leg pain - muscles hurting all over , bone pain My Dr put me on this med , 25 Mg 2 times a day . After a week or 2 I had chest pain so bad I had to go to the ER Twice , I thought I was having a heart attack! Left arm pain so bad I feel,as if my arm will fall off, like it's dying . Bone pain , muscle pain all over . Upper left stomach pain . My Dr did several EKG's , echocardiogram, treadmill stress test , nuclear stress test &amp; a heart cath . Heart is just fine . The problem is this med! Trying to wean off of it . Scared to just stop it . Problem is the Dr should have known that these were side effects of this med before prescribing it. Every time I take it , feeling terribly ill! Headache, neckache, stomach pain, arm pain , jaw pain , chest pain , bottom of my feet hurt , fingernails hurt, for a couple of days every single one of my teeth hurt, like they were coming loose. Watch out folks. This medicine is like poision! Once I can get weaned off of it, I will never take it again &amp; will research each medication before taking . $38,000.00 later in Medical bills ! :-(
1086|1087|BPH and Mild ED Initially I experienced a mild headache for approximately 2 days No other side effects experienced. I had been taking 10mg Terazosin for about 5 years prior for problems associated with BPH. Then I developed a mild ED problem so I decided to try Cialis. After 2 months the Cialis has really solved the mild ED problem. However, it has not done much for BPH urination problems yet. I will continue to evaluate Cialis for another couple of months as some medicines simply take a little time. I am not certain whether or not the prolonged terazosin use brought on the mild ED but I sure am glad it is gone. I feel very fortunate that I did not experience any of the side effects that other contributors described. Perhaps this is because I am a very physically fit 70 year old.

1095|1096|"Pain Management and Anxiety It immediately caused severe​ problems with concentration, blurred vision, upset stomach, and angry mood swings. It also caused problems with total lack of sex drive and caused overwhelming emotional problems. What makes this medication so bad is the 12-hour half life which I am sure you will read plenty of posts about. I hate this drug and anyone who prescribes it because they obviously haven't read any of the patient reviews. It looks like half of the people that take it have problems and the manufacturer failed to devise a plan to come off this medication. Also the manufacturer does not require the prescribing physician to advise the patient of the guaranteed side effects and addictive properties of this medication. This junk may have cost me my jo. Fortunately I can see a little bit of difference one week after discontinuing use. I will be calling a lawyer. No wonder the FDA did not approve their new drug for 2017 for Eli Lilly who invented Cymbalta and heavily advertised the drug without disclosing accurate side affects and withdrawal syndrome for people like me that had a bad encounter with this ""medication"". I would love to see all of the management for Eli Lilly forced to take this medication as they have advertised for a year and then cut them off completely so they will learn the real side effects of this drug that they so heavily advertised. I would pay good money to watch each person's life fall apart in front of their eyes. Whatever happened to the code of ethics that the scientists and doctors that work at Eli Lilly. I also have a real problem with the way this medication was dispensed at my Pharmacy and how there were none of the required FDA warnings on the any of the bottles that I was prescribed. What is wrong with doctors in America today. I tried to tell my doc"

1116|1117|Meniere's disease In the first few days I felt a little weak, and also felt numbness and tingling in my face, tongue, hands etc. But these went away and I no longer feel any side effects. This drug has been very effective in reducing the incidence of vertigo attacks. In the two months before I started taking it, I was having 3 or 4 disabling attacks a week. Since I have been taking it I have had only one serious attack in two months. I think my initial side effects were due to the drug lowering my blood pressure, which was not high to begin with; but since I have gotten used to it I am fine and would highly recommend it.

1156|1157|indigestion,burping, heartburn,GERD Sternum pain, arm soreness, occasional muscle twitch I used to get sternum pain on and off before I was diagnosed with GERD, but I noticed that my sternum pain got more severe after going on omeprazole. My GI said that it was because of my acid reflux. My armpit muscle was insanely sensitive to pressure which caused my arm and collar bone area to be a bit sore also. After reading that magnesium deficiency is common after taking it for a while, I took magnesium suplements as a procaution. I had muscle twitching maybe once or twice a day which worried me a little bit, but it's completely normal while on omeprazole. Currently I am still on it and was a little anxious over my symptoms so I looked up every symptom, and if something really is worrying you, contact your doctor. And also remember that it may not be omeprazole causing your symptoms, but the illness that it is fighting.

1170|1171|back surgery Fell asleep quickly and become light headed if I don't fall asleep Took after my back surgery and really helped with the combination of perks that I got from the hospital after surgery. For the people with all the negative effects from it make sure you read ALL the side effects so you know what you might be in store for and if you have any call your doctor ASAP. This is a VERY powerful drug with MAJOR side effects and yes it is possible you can die but that is very rare but can happen and it can be VERY addictive so take with caution...this information is not from some normal person I am a RN that works at a hospital. Please don't abuse this drug which most deaths from this drug is because of the toxicity of this drug and mixing it with alcohol which is the worse thing you could do so DON'T DO IT!!! Again it's a good drug to relieve some things but can be very dangerous so take with caution and make sure you know all the possible side effects before taking. Hope this helps.
1171|1172|SEVERE ACNE Redness,flakiness,dryness,irritation,burning. The side effects mentioned calm down after the first week. It's been 2 months and a half on this my face as gone from severe acne to very little I'm happy with the results my acne left scars but this also treats that so I'm happy but I hope by the third month the scars would be gone. The 1st month was hell but you get used to it and your skin begins to improve you can't complain. I posted a comment below after my third week and I believed this was working and I was right to trust it.

1173|1174|Migraine Initially:tingling in hands and feet, nausea, insomnia, difficulty finding words, spelling and completing basic math computation, loss of appetite, change of taste and smells. Tingling and nausea eventually subsided. After approx 8 weeks: Hair loss. Though this drug was difficult to adjust to, I stuck it out. The nausea was extreme in the beginning, but did eventually subside after a few weeks. I woke up at 4:30 every morning and could not get back to sleep. It did stop my daily migraines that I was suffering from. After about a month, I felt great, despite the mental cloudiness that was difficult to manage. For example, I struggled to remember driving routes I had traveled for years. I decided it was a trade-off I was willing to make. Unfortunately, one day I noticed my hair texture had changed. My normally thick, shiny, manageable hair became dry and brittle. Then the shedding started, approximately 2 months after I began taking the medicine. I tried to stick it out, but I lost close to 50% of my hair in the 2 weeks that followed. I discontinued. I have now been off the drug for a month, and my hair is still shedding and there has been little improvement in texture. I am hopeful that my hair will grow back, but this has been very stressful. My headache specialist has prescribed Zonegran as an alternative, but I am weary of anything now, especially because a month off of the medication has resulted in little improvement on the hair loss front.
1174|1175|Weight Loss Weight Loss, painful tingling in hands, feet, &amp; lips, loss of appetite, no taste in carbonation, lack of words, forgetfulness, charliehorses in the middle of the night, constant menstrul cycles, inability to partipate in school due to loss of thoughts and ideas. Definitely helped suppress my appetite to lose weight because I was on 30 mgs of Remeron for sleep and gained 60 pounds. But I was not pleased with the side effects but would have loved to stay on it if this did not occur. Just got off yesterday and now am taking Abilify. I was also taking Visterol with this 3 times a day.

1183|1184|Social and Generalized anxiety I'm very tired and fatigued during the day. To counteract the tiredness and low energy, I take caffeine and energy supplements, which in turn, make me have anxiety. But without the caffeine, I feel too tired to function. Increased depression, but that could be from my life, not from the medication. It's been harder for me to watch what I eat, and I've gained weight. It helps with Social and generalized anxiety, and has fewer sides effects compared to the other anti-anxiety medications I've tried. The fatigue can be hard to deal with, and drinking caffeine drinks and energy supplements all day to combat the fatigue can make anxiety worse for me, but I need the extra energy to function. My energy is naturally low off of medication, but on this medicine it's extremely low.

1188|1189|Depression augmented with abilify Nausea, acne, itching skin. Restlessness, talking a lot need to read and walk around at the same time, vomiting after reasonably vigorously exercises such as walking. Slowed intestinal motility, minor food cravings, I'm watching the weight gain and fighting it to the death. This is NOT necessary!! It is so far the least of the culprits for mysterious and seemingly uncontrollable weight gain. I would blame some or most of that on the effects and the way the body is affected from hormones like prolactin and others you just can't control your own entire brain. First two days at 2 mg I was light headed hungry nauseous and walking and excercizing to work through the beginning Hunger not uncontrollable! Eat the healthy food. Prepair meals maybe if you have motivation to use! Yes I had the restlessness. I kept reading thinking and pacing. Walk; even if it's a small space indoors. It's worth working through its my favorite choice so far in regards to the PARTIAL agonist at select dopamine receptors it worked fast. I might get to a point where my depression could lift and I would feel happy again, like the early school years! I have high hopes now.

Although I do LOVE how Bentyl has helped by horrible stomach cramps, I did develop hives and this had reassured me that I cannot tolerate it. I had tolerated it up until that point because it worked so well. I first began with auditory hallucinations when taking the maximum of 3 a day. I stopped this and began only taking it once a day. I still developed hives and was disappointed I could not use it anymore.
1199|1200|Osteoporosis 25% bone loss Flu-like symptoms beginning the first evening. Chills, muscle aches, headache, nausea, bitter taste, diarrhea, sleepiness, weakness. Chills, aches, nausea were severe for the first two days, but subsided after about 4 days. I was unable to work or do normal activities for 5 full days the first and second month I took Boniva. I skipped a month, (just too busy to be sick for 5 days) and took my third dose the following month. By my third dose the symptoms had stopped except for mild weakness, sleepiness and diarrhea lasting about 2 days. I think I can live with that. I gave Boniva a 2 (Not Satisfied) because of the severity of the side effects for the first two doses, I won't know if it was effective until my next bone scan. As long as the side-effects remain mild, I plan to stay on the drug until my next DEXA scan.

I could go to the store and walk past the wine aisle no problem and wouldn't even think about drinking. Unfortunately my liver staged a revolt, (ironic!) so I had to stop taking it. Of course the cravings came right back. Great while it lasted though...

So I stopped! I was already having opiate withdrawals and wasn't pleasant to be around. But this evil pill made me even more mean but I had no idea that I was! I forgot so much about this time of my life! But what I do know now is that I'm a single guy who's fighting a DUI but can't remember hardly anything about the insodent! I'm really scared and haven't taken this Evil drug in almost a year. Nobody believes me about this drug because of my past! I don't even remember if I drank that day or not! All I remember about that day is waking up and hitting a mailbox! I found out that they shouldn't have prescribed me those medications together! I have never had a DUI before! I could have hurt someone! How is this drug still legal?????

I remember just people watching and being in tears while thinking I would love to just be able to walk care free again, without pain. Literally every part of my body hurt. The first dose made me feel strange and I decided I was done with meds. But I got to a point to where I was so depressed that I gave it another try...and OMG...I feel like me again. I can shop, I can stand and walk for long periods of time again! I just pray that it continues to work. I was on plaquenil for 9 months and it was literally killing me. My dr kept saying to give it a year. I was getting worse and worse, did my research and yep..I was right. Plaquenils rare side effects cause muscle damage and worsens chronic pain....my dr said..""sorry bout that""...Thank you Cymbalta!!!!"

1254|1255|chronic Lyme Disease lots of nausea and occasional vomiting, occasionally took over the counter anti-nausea meds- helped. You have to take it with food! I also got sun sensitivity, which was pretty bad towards the end- I usually dont' sunburn easily, and this was bad enough to be annoying. It worked very, very well for my chronic Lyme- I went from disabled to highly functional in two months (the treatment takes much longer than that or you will relapse, see www.ILADS.org for more information on proper treatment). I eventually had to switch to azithromycin and then herbal treatments because of the nausea/vomiting, but I would go back on doxy if necessary as the nausea was less of a problem than some other antibiotic side effects. This is the least serious of the antibiotics side effects I've felt while having Lyme. Some Lyme patients experience a temporary worsening of symptoms- a Herxheimer reaction- which is not a side effect but is caused by dying bacteria, explained at the ILADS treatment guidelines website. Other patients may need different antibiotic for their chronic Lyme or a combination, however, no one antibiotic helps everyone with this condition. Long term treatments (even years) usually put it into remission.
1255|1256|Pain Management/ Anxiety Nausea, Jaw Clenching, Yawning, Weight Loss, Loss of Appetite, Unable to Orgasm, Fatigue I started this medication at 37.5mg QD. I wrote about my experience wioth that dosage in January. I am following up regarding the 75mg. I experienced the jaw clenching again, it never went away it just happened less until i upped the dosage. It has started to subside after 30 days. I started feeling nauseous about one month into taking this medication and noticed a severe loss of appetite, some days I don't eat lunch or dinner. I get nauseous when i try to force myself to eat when I'm not hungry. My migraines are manageable most days with this medication. So far it has helped more then hurt. I will warn you, I forgot to take my med ONE DAY and all of the initial side effects came back. The nausea, the jaw clenching, the constant yawning, the loss of appetite... and some additional side effects like very vivid dreams and restless sleep. Still, I believe the benefits outweigh the side effects for me.
1256|1257|depression Mania, terrible withdrawal Worked great at first, then started feeling manic/anxious/irritable. Was talking really fast and interrupting people and not getting much sleep. Decided to get off of it and am still slowly withdrawing. It is hell, brain zaps, shaking, extreme restlessness, physical pain in hands and feet, heart palpitations. I have been on many different antidepressants and never experienced such miserable withdrawal symptoms. Wish I had been warned.

1272|1273|ocd, schitzoid thinking i felt sedated but overall at a low dosage it helped me to stop obsessing with intrusive thoughts since it helps the brain to slow down and stop fighting all the time i would recommend it because it is less sedating than seroquil and resperidol and other similar drugs also it does not induce the appetite

1277|1278|Prevent unplanned pregnancy Heavy constant bleeding, uterine polyps and headaches Do not get it!... I had a constant period for 3 months straight with headaches. I went to my family doctor who put it in and they took it out and sent me to the gynecologist. They found uterine polyps and told me I can have them removed and run the risk of them coming back, or have them removed along with an ablation. In fear of them coming back, I had the ablation....now I can't have any more kids.

I quit it cold-turkey after ~3 months. No side effects of quitting it, to my (and my doctor's) surprise! I now take it infrequently for really bad days. I have finally gotten some significant relief thru traction treatment. I've tried every other treatment out there, short of surgery (Im not a 'surgical patient'). Kadian definitely helped me thru some rough times.

1284|1285|Depression/Anxiety During the honeymoon period of the first month I experienced agitation, higher anxiety, increase in sweating, and daily headaches(aspirin worked well). Now agitation went away but the rest are still present. I have chronic lyme disease mostly causing exhaustion and depression/anxiety. I had taken 6 different SSRI's all failures and this seems to work the best on my depression. But I'm still miles away from being a functioning adult again.
1285|1286|Bipolar Initial side effects included trouble with vocabulary, feeling flaky/flighty. Slight insomnia which passed after a few weeks. Lamictal has restored my ability to feel calm again.
1286|1287|Despression, anxiety Dizziness upon standing, nausea, feeling extremely apathetic, hot and cold flashes, increased heart rate and shortness of breath Would not reccomend for most people, especially if you are not an adult. Start on a small dose! (5mg).
1287|1288|Panic attacks Initially had insomnia, loss of appetite, increased anxiety. Having great success with escitalopram for panic and anxiety! My symtoms have improved tremendously in the past few months after panic attacks had started to ruin my life. I sought help quickly because I recognized I needed it. Have never taken meds before and was quite scared...but was more afraid of the anxiety! First 10 days were difficult with increased anxiety, insomnia and loss of appetite. Thereafter, I noticed subtle improvements each day, and now at 3 months I feel normal again....sleeping and eating well with no anxiety!

The doctor says it takes at least 3 months for the lupron to leave your system. I would NOT recommend the drug to anyone until the do a thorough research of possible side effects - there must be an alternative. For me Side effects are life changing and I am hoping that the doctor was right in telling me it will take 3 months for the LUPRON to wear off
1291|1292|Restless leg syndrome None I replaced Requip, which had many very unpleasant side effects, including nausea, drowsiness and headaches after one glass of wine with dinner. The low dose that I take is effective with no side effects. I recommend trying it for RLS.

1322|1323|Daily headaches/ migraines First, Topiramate works like gangbusters to get rid of my daily headaches. Like 95%. But.... THIS DRUG IS TOXIC! Everything you've read: severe cognitive impairment, say goodbye to your memory, extreme sedation, I also have daily nausea so need additional sedating meds for that plus sea bands. Topiramate is also used as a mood stabilizer so for me, anyway, there is a severe dulling of emotions - I guess it makes me not care as much that I can barely hold a conversation, or remember what I did yesterday. Thank god I haven't been fired yet as I've explained the situation to my supervisor. But it's dumb and dumber all day then drag myself home, plop on the couch, exhausted from the drug. Life not too much improved! I've also taken generic Pamelor which didn't do much for my headaches but I had some minor psych issues such as suicidal ideation, anxiety, and depression. I'm ready for headache drug #3

1327|1328|high total cholesterol and high LDL constipation, gas and general GI discomfort; sore throat; and ringing in ears which started about one week after starting Welchol and continued until I stopped. Had tried statins several years ago but had way too many serious side effects. My cardiologist recently convinced me to try Welchol for three months, but the GI distress plus the new ringing in my ears (which I never ever had before) forced me to stop after the three months. Did reduce my LDL, but only slightly. Not worth the side effects.
1328|1329|Birth control and Weight gain Extreme breast tenderness in my left boob after first 3 months of taking the 21 day pill. Mood swings have worsened with time. High intolerance. Lack of interest in activity. Suicidal ideation. Extreme depression. Dizziness. Extreme fatigue. Increased appetite in conjunction with an extreme level of nausea. Bad blood clots when on my period. Pros: No pregnancy while on it; Period days 3-4 from my usual 5-6/7 The Tenderness in my left boob keeps increasing with time. The pain is so much that I started wearing wireless bras. I can't even casually lie down on my left side. Never had period blood clots before but ever since I started taking Yasmin 21 day pill I've been having finger-sized clots and it's disturbing. Visiting my doctor tomorrow and most likely I'll have to switch to other contraceptive methods. Contact me for any questions. I'll help where I can.

1330|1331|PTSD Increased anxiety, can't leave my apartment, scared My neck and shoulders are very stiff and hard to move. I can't take a deep breath , feels like someone has squeezed my lungs. I think I had the same effects when I tried Lexapro.
1331|1332|depression, ptsd, anxiety Upset stomach, insomnia, difficulty having an orgasm, weight loss For me I think the pros outweigh the cons. Upset stomach at worse is diarrhea which is not often. The rest of the time its just gas. I am also taking ambien for sleep so insomnia is manageable. Sexual side effects are really sporadic. Days where I am not able to achieve orgasm end up being fun. My wife enjoys me f**king her like a gorilla. It was worse when I first started taking the medication. I think my weight loss stemmed from the diagnosis but my weight has tapered off. All the side effects were worse at the beginning, but now I am a lot more stable in my daily life.
1332|1333|Chronic Urticaria Zyrtec alleviated the hives but I began to notice stomach pain, dry eyes, tinnutus, and then when I tried to stop taking it I got vertigo and awful itching and hives- much worse than the original problem I started taking Zyrtec for. My dermatologist said if it was resolving the hives then I could continue. By then I checked withdrawal symptoms online and found so many people struggling to get off this awful drug. The itching is fierce and I woukd get hives several inches across plus swollen lips and bumps of over an inch came up randomly on my forehead or wrist. I did more research and found that Zyrtec supresses Histamine ratger than breaking it down. I had very low DAO enzyme in my body so coukd not vreak the excess histamine down naturally. After weeks of hell once I stopped taking Zyrtec I bought Histame capsules on the internet and within 3 days. had the itching under control. I tackled the root cause of my low DAO with the help of a nutritionist and was able to stop the Histame after a few weeks. I do eat a low histamine diet now which also helps. I would never ever take Zyrtec again Zyrtec shoudnt be available over the counter. It is dangerous and needs to be reviewed. huge no of people have problems stopping it

Loss of joy and ability to have hope for the future. After taking Aricept I felt impending doom. I was just waiting to die. Felt horrible. It worsened my memory. Took away my ability to take care of myself. It is the worst drug ever taken in 81 years. Thank God I got off it after three months despite objections from Doctor that ""You can't go back on it"". I NEVER want to go back on it. My kids say I have improved significantly in the 2+ weeks since I stopped after 3 months on. It was the worst three months of my life. I can't explain how subtley it creeps up on your mind and steals your higher ability to think of feel. I was a walking dead. My kids will attest. I Additional studies need to be done on the severe side effects I experienced. It was nearly fatal. I wanted to die. Thank God my daughter took it away. She read all the warnings. My doctor recommended keeping me on it, but thank God my daughter has a stron spirit. She saved me and I have to write this in response to getting my life back. Even if I only have one day. I now have hope in the morning when I pray. On Aricept, I couldn't remember to pray. I got so confused and angry that I prayed evey day that an angel of mercy would come and take me away from my confusion and frustration. I wouldn't have lived more than a few more weeks on Aricept. I know that. I am strong and I can face this memory loss by writing things down and using a calendar. On Aricept I couldn't remember what to write. I was as good as a walking dead person. I give thanks we got off that evil drug. Be warned. It can be a wicked drug."

1362|1363|ADD, depression, anxiety exessive sweating when sporting, sleep interruption My diagnosis was ADD with depression and anxiety, my main complaint was feelings of chronic fatigue. Having tried many drugs (stimulants, citalopram, escitalopram, Wellbutrin, sertraline and even Parnate), psychiatrists wanted to give up medication therapy. After much insistence the psychiatrist finally agreed to prescribe venlafaxine. And with success, finally an antidepressant that helped! Less tension, less social anxiety, less often sick and almost no suicidal thoughts. Especially in combination with sporting, I feel much better. Side effects are excessive sweating when sporting and every night I wake up halfway. I now take 112.5 mg (75 + 37.5 mg), if I take a higher dose I feel very sleepy. I took venlafaxine twice previously and when I felt better for a while, I quit. Reducing gradually went fine without any severe withdrawal. For tapering I used venlafaxine of the brand Bluefish (available here in Europe). The capsules do not consist of granules but of tablets with each 12.5 mg. Every week I took one tablet less and I didnt experienced any severe withdrawal. Only at the end a bit of the common electric shocks, but I didnt find it very disruptive, more like you had a glass of wine.

Although I haven't had my period since getting the implanon, it's still not worth it. I'm having it removed next week. The doctor who implanted it raved about how it doesn't cause weight gain and how few side effects it has. That's why I got it. I just recently went to another doctor with my concerns and she laughed! She said that the doctor who implanted it must not know very much about it because the top 2 reasons people have come to her to have it removed has been of the weight gain and depression!

1379|1380|Depression, Anxiety Insomnia, too mellowed out, numb to difficult life events, sex is near impossible your broken the whole time with this medication. Started feeling my depression taking over me after my grandparents died 2 days apart in January 2017. I was on meds growing up from the passing of my mother when I was 13. Stopped for a few years and was prescribed to Lexapro. BIGGEST MISTAKE. Lexapro is only good for one thing, if you seriously don't want to feel anything. Yes, it made me somewhat cope with what I was dealing with. But the side effects drove me crazy especially the insomnia. After taking it for 4 months I decided I wanted to get off it and just be completely free of medication. started taking 5MG after seeing my doctor and gave it a try for around 5-7 days. Getting off Lexapro has been the worst experience through all of this. Cold turkey is ballsy with this. 24 hours of the day with constant anxiety attacks, shortness of breath, cold sweats, restlessness, panic attacks. I get these moments that I feel so dark and hopeless it reminds me of the same exact feeling the day my mother died when I was a kid. through this process nobody, not even my Doctor told me getting off this is extremely hard. Through this process I lost my job because the effects are so unbearable I cant even leave my house. I am at the end of week 2 and its really kicking in. If you decide to take this medication just think about the future.
1380|1381|Endometrial mass The first few months were great then the hot flashes kicked in. By month three I have been experiencing hot flashes so bad that it's disrupting my sleep. I just got my fourth I injection and my mood has taken a serious turn for the worst. My cycles have stopped now, though, and I'm not experiencing grave bloating and pain like I had been. While I am no longer having severe menstrual cycles and pain like I was experiencing, the hot flashes have been difficult to manage. Within the last two weeks my mood has been horrible, I am experiencing severe nausea/dizziness and the hot flashes are becoming intolerable. My lack of sleep is definitely not helping my mood and my energy level is at an all-time low. While I am not experiencing as much pain during intercouse, I am still feeling some discomfort. I am on a 6-month plan and have 2 shots to go--and i am definitely looking forward to being done with this and not looking forward to menopause. That's for sure!

1386|1387|Lumbar Fusion Occasional anxiety I began Opana ER in September 2012, after the Dilaudid just wouldn't relieve the pain anymore. The begining dosage was 10 mg. and after one week, jumped up to 20 mg. Two weeks later needed to go to 30 mg. and that seem to do the trick, using Dilaudid for break through pain. The two of them together work well though Dilaudid is rarely needed. Within the next year, I will require and additional fusion on the next disc up - L2-3. I'm also quite sure I will be going up to 40 mg by then as well.

1401|1402|Anxiety and muscle spasms Drowsiness, tiredness, sleepiness Xanax is a wonderful medication. I'm a chronic pain patient and my doctor switched me from Valium to Xanax for both anxiety and muscle spasms. It takes effect very quickly and lasts several hours. It completely relaxes up my tight spasms I experience and overall loosens up my body, thus reducing my pain. It also reduces my severe anxiety and puts me at ease. It's also very mild. I highly recommend it.

The drug may have helped anxiety a bit but WITHDRAWAL IS SO HARD. please think before taking this drug. It put me in more of a depression then ever before when i tried to come off of it. I had a full blown panic attack for the first time, dark thoughts, headaches, exhaustion,diarrhea, aches. I had been on paxil and celexa previously and never had withdrawal side effects. The benefits by no means outweigh the side effects. I finally was tapered off with the assistance of prozac- hoping prozac will help but my ultimate goal is no meds!!

1418|1419|Depression, anxiety At the very beginning, I did experience an inability to have an orgasm. That lasted a few weeks. My brain feels very hot and full at times and sometimes I get a sensation in my brain like a distant thunder rumble, curious but not painful or alarming. I don't think they're related to brain zaps. I have a decreased craving for sugar. Effexor saved my life! I've been chronically depressed since early childhood, so I had no personal frame of reference about how other people experience life. I had been on Zoloft and Prozac a long time ago with no effect, I learned how things I had accepted as immutable are actually optional. I would recommend Effexor if you haven't had luck with other antidepressants.

1424|1425|MS - Severe Nerve Pain I had my first MS attack about 6 months ago. Along with many other symptoms, I had severe nerve pain in various places in my body, especially my neck, upper back, shoulders and lower back. Neuro started me out on 100 mg, 3 x Daily and made me gradually increase the mg, stating that it must be at least 300 mg doses in order to be effective for pain. If you start out on the higher doses before your body gets used to it, you will have severe problems with sleepiness, dizziness, lethargy, etc. If your doc doesn't explain this to you, you should get another doctor! This is a fantastic medication for severe, debilitating nerve pain! I have searched for years for anything that would ease my pain and this does wonders! Start out at 100 mg, 3 x daily, and gradually increase (and I mean GRADUALLY) to at least 300 mg, 3 x daily! Stay at that dose for a few weeks and see if it helps you. If it doesn't, then gradually move up to 600 mg, 3 x daily, and so on! You cannot double the dosage Don't get me wrong, I still have pain and take opioids, ibuprophen, and tramadol at times. I also take Baclofen for severe spasticity and muscle pain. I think the doctor at my Pain Clinic needs to raise the dosage of my Gabapentin, because I notice my pain getting worse every day, but I could not survive without this medication! The dosage limits are very high and seemingly more effective the higher the dosage. Small doses like 100 mg, will not work at all for pain! Good luck to all of you! You deserve to be pain-free! Blessings!

1442|1443|mild to moderate acne Mild itching, redness, skin flakiness. After being plagued with moderate adult acne, including painful cystic acne flares, I finally went to my derm to be put on a regimen. She prescribed Solodyn 105mg daily, Acanya mornings after cleansing and before moisturizing ,and Tazorac 0.05% after cleansing and after moisturizing at night 3-4x a week and working up to every other night. After using Solodyn my breakouts, including cystic flares reduced dramatically. After 1 month I started weaning off Solodyn and stopped it entirely 2 months after starting. All the while I continued using Tazorac at night, every other night. After 2.5 months use, skin had become clear, bumps and scars smoothed out, hyper pigmentation from past flares and pimples were minimized. And I had this glow. And everyone who hadn't seen me thought I had lost YEARS in age, as it also is well-known for anti-aging affects. Only minor irritations for me because, I think Solodyn kept the initial purge effects in check. And I apply Neutrogena sensitive skin moisture before apply Tazorac, only at night and only every other night. I had pretty bad Acne, blotchiness, dark spots in April when I started and by July, little to no acne, spots, blotches, bumps cleared up, skin looked radiant and everyone was commenting on how young I looked. For me, all three worked together, but Tazorac I continue to use as maintenance. May not work for everyone, but for me an absolute miracle.

Saw no problems with soda, but during withdrawal period coffee tasted like fried rice.
1444|1445|Triple Negative Breast Cancer 2000mg twice a day 14 days on 7 off for 8 rounds. Hands feel tight, palm side looks red finger tips appear swollen loss of finger prints tingling burning or open cut feeling yet tolerable. Tightness when closing hands. Difficulty sleeping all night, wake up a lot. During the 7 days off the first 3 days the side effects seem to enhance. Sometimes feel pulse in hands. Done with 8 rounds, off one wk side effects seem worse. Hands, feet feel very warm and redness. Constantly wanting more lotion. Started Vanicream today to see if it will help. Fatigue at times, developed thyroid issue, 1st overly active, changed within approx 1-2 wks to be under active. Hopefully this will correct itself. I'm very cold a lot, not sure if it's due to thyroid or Chemo. I was cold often prior to diagnosis. Unsure if this has made a difference in helping to keep recurrence of cancer. I don't know how to rate this at this time. I'm concerned because I've been off the med completely now for 7 days and feet and hands hurt more than while on the treatments. 11/07/17 Have not been able to find information on how long it takes for improvement. Really want to know what others experienced after. I wish to know details of what to possibly expect after completion. Are my symptoms normal?
1445|1446|Seasonal allergies Anxiety, night terrors, personality change, emotionality, tics We gave our 10 year old daughter Zyrtec for approx 5 months ...it really affected her badly. We thought it was tween hormones at first but she became extremely moody, anxious, fearful, had spasms and just wasnt herself..to the point where we consulted her pediatrician and took her to a therapist. We finally put two and two together and discovered that the only thing that changed in her life was the addition of Zyrtec. I started researching side effects and my mind was blown! Immediately took her off it and our happy, spunky little girl is steadily returning. Its been a week and shes a whole different child. We feel horrible that it took us so long to figure this out, our poor daughter was suffering for too long due to this supposedly safe OTC medication!

1447|1448|migrain pain even after neck fusion Took actiq after neck fusion &amp; along with the durigesic fentynal patch around 1999. It was working great &amp; every 4 hours, my migraine would come back &amp; then the actiq would stop it. This continued until they changed the production of it from the US to the european method. For some reason, the actiq in the new formulation never did work. As soon as I used it, the migraine continued &amp; continued without working at all. I have no idea why the new formulation changed the working of the fentanyl in the med but it no longer worked. Besided it not working, while using it, the new formulation was so rough that it rubbed sores on my cheek for the time I was trying to see if it was going to somehow start working.

1460|1461|"Clinical Depression Started out as ""best thing since sliced bread"", but brain zaps began. Been slowly weaning from it and it looks like it's going to take a while.Fish Oil (Omegas?) Seem to help with withdrawals.If talking helps then I'd love to hear from anyone. Email below here somewhere, I guess. Been on numerous SSRI's for over 10 years. This SNRI started off great, 30mg once a day for a week or so then up to 30mg 2 times a day. Nearly a month ago I noticed the ""brain zaps"", I guess. More like my brain was turned into ultra fine steel wool and I could hear and feel my steps at times. I could hear my eyes blink, or a squishy sound in my ears (like someone squeezing steel wool inside my ears). The sounds came along with the ""mild electric jolt"" feeling too, from toes to head often. Generic form I have are 6 small white pills inside the blue and white capsule. Dropped from 60mg to 30mg for several weeks. Then began removing 3 of the small white pills to take 15mg for a few weeks. Was going to remove one more to go to 10mg then one more later to take 5mg for a few weeks. As John, the Duke, Wayne says at one point in McClintock, ""Ya-ta-hey"". I guess it's Comanche for something, but it seems appropriate for this time. I'm on day 2 of NO Generic Cymbalta. Didn't drop it by 5's as planned. Yesterday was a good day. Today is much vertigo, zaps, steel wool sounds that come and go. Have also been having the WEIRDEST dreams. I wake up and go right back to the dream, like for a freaking commercial break! Dreams seem to go ALL night. I have sleep apnea (5'7"", 160 pounds), and use my CPAP, but I'm still tired, I assume, from the dreams. Not really nightmares, like as for many I read about.

1492|1493|Depression and GAD (Anxiety) Long-term side effects; virtually none with the exception of over-sleeping in the morning and not getting tired in the evening. Short-term; nausea, fast-heart-rate, nightmares, erectile dysfunction and anorgasmia (first few weeks). Diarrhoea and difficulty achieving orgasm (first month or so). Brilliant for depression. Started out on 37.5mg for the first week or so, then went to the full 75mg and have stayed there since. Switched to the extended release a few weeks in to relieve nausea. Touch-wood, never had anything so effective for my depression. I think a lot of people are started out too high on this drug and end up with nasty side effects followed by an unpleasant time tapering down.

1504|1505|to prevent pregnancy 6 months of bleeding nonstop!!!! I would not recommend this birth control to anyone!!! I was so excited when I first heard about an implant that is good for 3 years. It was so exciting to me that I wouldnt need to remember taking a pill for an entire 3 years. This was the biggest mistake I made in my entire life. 4 Days after I got the implant the bleeding started. I was told by my doctor that it would subside and to give it time... I waited for 6 entire months bleeding everyday before I got fed up and got it removed. and yes... by 6 months of bleeding i really mean 6 entire months of bleeding. Not one day of being free. No girl in her right mind wants to go through that. It is very rough emotionally because of the pure frustration that it wont stop and also it added stress on my relationship because it gets in the way of my sex life. I got this implant for birth control and all it did was block my entire sex life!! Now that it is out i got back on the pill i was on in highschool. I have been on it for a month and Im still bleeding from that stupid implant. I really feel like it messed my body up and I dont know when the bleeding will stop and I cant stand it!!!!! Everytime I go to the doctor they dont have much to say and act like its no big deal... If i could make my decision all over again I would NEVER have chosen Implanon!!!!!!

1511|1512|Fibro, herniated disc Constipation I was on the duragesic patch for 2 1/2 years--it worked but I had a truly bad experience with a bad patch. Per my request my doc took me off of the patch &amp; I needed to be on something and she recommended Kadian. I wish I new about this years ago--this works well for me. I am able to do a lot more--I don't have to worry about anything falling off and not getting the meds. With Kadian and any other controlled medication u must take it as scheduled -- don't miss a dose or you risk withdrawal symptoms. Great medication for those who need it--you must have chronic every day pain &amp; have tried several other narcotics prior to using Kadian. Kadian is a great medication when prescribed ton the right person and taken properly.

1513|1514|Derealisation, depression, apathy. Loss of libido. Apathy. My depression was already apathetic to an extent, although anxiety plays a big part. At 10mg this drug made it worse, to the point all I wanted to do was stare at the ceiling. I have the feeling, although not a doctor, this drug is better for those who are hyper, with lots of energy but suffer depression. It will calm them down. If you are already exhausted and uninterested in life, this seems to make it worse. At least it did for me. That may not be the case for everyone. 10mg was unbearable for me. 5mg and 2.5mg were better, with the latter the best. It took the edge off depression without causing impossible apathy. Even at that low dose however, my sex drive was cut to about 20%. Not good for relationships. I advise giving it a try if you need help, it works very well for many, but for no more than a month. If you feel worse by then, go back to your doctor and try something else. The three month rule is a fallacy. Overall I think it helped to some extent at a very low dose. I feel better now off the drug, but that may be because there was some healing while on it.

1516|1517|Endometriosis Brain fog, Intense hot flashes, Bouts of rage, Change in body odor, Inability to control reactions &amp; emotions, Weight gain (70 pounds in 6 months), Susceptibility to further weight gain, Inability to lose weight, Abdominal pain &amp; hernias, Increased stomach fat, Irrational mood swings Many symptoms resolved within 3-6 months of ending treatment. Body odor resolved eight years after ending treatment. Inability to lose weight is still on-going. Saliva testing shows long-term hormonal imbalances seven years after ending treatment. Weakened abdominal walls leading to hernias on both sides. No reduction in endometriosis symptoms while using drug.
1517|1518|Endometriosis and fibroids Dry mouth and soar throat, alterning bleeding and spotting, weight gain, fatigue, menstrual pain, joint pain, severe acne, no sex drive, constipation, frequent urinating, mood swings I tried both the 1-month and 3-month shot. After every injection, I had loss of muscle strenght in my legs for 1 to 3 days depending on the dosage. I could barely walk during that time. I've been bleeding constantly from spotting to regular menstruation for more than four months now. I have constant menstrual pain since the 3-month shot. I will have an hysterectomy in 10 days and can't wait to make it all stop. The severe acne on my back just adds to all the symptoms and contributes to my mood swings. I just hope it all gets better after the surgery because before the Lupron, the endometriosis was aggravating my IBS to the point I was sick all the time and could not keep food in. Now that part is better now but the side effects are just as bad, simply different.
1518|1519|Stage 2 Prostate Cancer Hot flashes (up to 2X per hour)--causing poor sleep; loss of libido, weight gain (+10 lbs), breast growth, reduction in physical endurance--even with weight training, 40% higher cholesterol; high ALP and VERY HIGH (130) GGT--indicating liver problems. Took two 3-month Lupron shots as part of proton beam therapy (two months prior, two months during, two months post radiation). Was glad to get the first one to stall progression of Stage 2 prostate cancer, but dreaded getting the second one. No apparent effect from the first shot during the first three weeks (was beginning to wonder if they gave me the right shot), then libido started to drop fast in the fourth week and frequent (up to 2X per hour) hot flashes started--which are a nuisance in the daytime, but debilitating for sleep at night. The second 3-month Lupron shot timed out three months ago, but the hot flashes are unabated, libido is coming back very slowly, and it is very hard to shed the ten pounds I gained while on the drug. The combination of proton treatment and Lupron has resulted in my last three post-treatment PSA tests coming in at .1 (5.4 pre-treatment). My latest lab report, however shows a 40% increase in cholesterol and a very high GGT reading of 130 (65 is the upper limit), meaning my liver has been damaged. I had no idea when I agreed to take the drug that liver damage would be part of the deal and the hot flashes and loss of libido would continue for at least several months past the end of treatment.
1519|1520|Stage 4 prostate cancer PSA 60 Hot flashes in the late evenings I was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer and the cancer had spread to my lungs and lymph nodes. I took 1 month injection for 2 months then a 4 month injection. After two months, my PSA went from 60 down to 0.4. I remained very active and my energy level never decreased either. I am also juvenile diabetic and Lupron did NOT effect my diabetes. I would highly recommend Lupron. It had very little side effects for me and left NO permanent damage like chemo and radiation do. People need to listen to me. THIS STUFF WORKS!!!

1544|1545|Bladder Neck Inflammation and Pain Dull heachache, red fully eyes, facial flushing, eye pressure and pain I took this drug after my urologist suggested it because of pain in my uretha from a bladder neck inflammation. This drug works great for ED or any erectile failure. HOWEVER, I get yearly glaucoma exams because my mother had it in her 60s, and my optic nerve is irregular showing a predisposition for the disease. My checkups had been fine until my last one when they told me I have A LOSS OF VISION IN MY LEFT EYE showing that I am now fully glaucomic. The Doctors do not attribute this to the use of Viagara but I can tell that I am almost positive that the use of this drug caused damage to my optic nerve which precipitated an early onset of glaucoma, which I may have had to contend with in my 50's or 60's. The drug is a a known vasodilator which will suddenly increase the pressure in your eye. Not enough to cause a NAION (stroke), but after continued use over years, I DO BELIEVE that IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR OPTICE NERVE as I belileve it did mine. You will not even notice it is happening until you get a visual field exam which I encourage anyone taking this drug over the long term to do. WHAT DO YOU THINK is happening to your eyes, after you take this drug and you notice eye pressure, redness, pain and swelling which lasts for the duration of the drug life in your body. This drugs is causing you the slightest damage with every use that will only come to light after many years of using it. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO!!! IF YOU DO, PLEASE GET A FULL EYE EXA

1571|1572|Moderate Cystic Acne I started using the tazorac cream and it made my face look like an oil slick! Also, it dried out my face so bad (yep, at the same time making it super oily) and my face hurt to touch and was super bright red. It peeled so bad I was embarrased to leave the house. Not to mention, my acne was never worse in my life during the first 3 months!!! I looked like a joke! The first 3 months were horrific! My skin was red, peeling, acne-ridden, and oily! I was so upset and depressed about my face the first 3 months, but was told that was the magic number of months to wait as far as results go. Since my face was still gross after 3 months, I asked my doctor to switch me to tazorac gel 0.1% and it started working better. I think it must have been the mineral oil in the cream that made me sooooo greasy. Anyway, tazorac gel is working fine now. I get a few deep cystic pimples now, but not as bad as before. I never touch my face, clean it with Mary Kay cleanser for oily skin, and clean my face 2 times per day. I occasionally use toner and use Mary Kay moisturizer for oily skin. I always apply the moisturizer 1 hour prior to using Taz at night to keep from horrible peeling. I don't recommend skipping the moisturizer, no matter how greasy you think your face is. I also use Duac cream each morning. This has been working for the past few months, but isn't super affordable. I've tried everything you can imagine Rx and OTC, except for Accutane. Not worth the side effects for me. I hope this blog was useful to others struggling with acne.

OR how about it gives you a heart condition...excellent that means you can take more drugs...$$$ yesss. OR one that shrinks your brain so your so stupid and fried that you just keep chowing down on all the bullshit phsychotropic drugs. OR one that gives you mental issues in the first place. THERE I SAID IT!!! Look if your going to let someone judge you on nothing that has any scientific evidence with drugs that they have no clue what they actually really do to you then guess what...maybe you are crazy. DO NO HARM does not apply to phsychiatry. They are money hungry script writing assholes who dont care about you. Try harder jerks. Just like the rest. Time to try something that has no side effects and works. How about maybe even a cure for cancer? But wheres the money in that?

1588|1589|Bipolar II, PTSD, Anxiety, Insomnia Involuntary eye movement, swollen lymph nodes/glands, headaches, nausea, blurred vision, couldn't articulate to save my life, slurred speech, itching, dry mouth (upon withdrawal), insomnia (upon withdrawal), bad anxiety (upon withdrawal) originally, I was very satisfied with this drug. It helped me sleep, took care of my moods, I was stable, my anxiety was gone. It was wonderful. I had some interesting side effects which I thought I could live with until I discovered swollen glands. My pdoc never heard of it before, so I went to the doctor and had several tests done just to be told I am perfectly healthy and I need to stop taking the drug. The withdrawal of this drug is SO bad it felt like I was dying. It shot me off so badly into the deep end, I am now far worse than I was BEFORE I took the drug. I still experience insomnia (though my pdoc now put me on valproate 400mg and seroquel 50mg which does wonders for the insomnia) but my anxiety is really bad and my eye vision is not what it used to be (i struggle to move my eyes quickly). My lymph nodes are STILL not gone which terrifies me and I probably have to go back and get more tests done (not sure what more they can do AS I AM PERFECTLY HEALTHY). I advise strong caution when using this drug, or considering using it. It can work great for some but completely terrible for others. It's a very dependent drug and the addiction is bad. In the end I think the risks are just too great, there are many other wonderful drugs to be taken for bipolar, lamictal is not the only one out there.

Adding Januvia to my other prescriptions (Metformin and Glipizide) had a great effect on my blood sugar levels and I was very pleased. However, when I read about the increased chances of pancreatitis and possibly pancreatic cancer, I stopped taking it. I am once again having problems regulating my sugar level so I would not be surprised to be on insulin soon. Some studies I have read indicate that Januvia is safer when taken with metformin but I don't know how true that is. I was very happy to get the effects I experienced, but I am very apprehensive about the possible risks.

For example, I can be sitting on the couch, stuck in a position, with absolutely no idea what I am doing or what my intentions are, and it becomes terrifying to choose, say, whether to wash my hands or brush my teeth, even though I only need to do the latter. I am very often confused, and everything except the current day feels like it happened last week. I suppose it doesn't sound severe, but it is very debilitating and I feel so empty, like a bunch of my personality is missing. I will note that this got WORSE over the period of time I've been using it, not better, and worse as the dosage was increased as well.

1628|1629|"Seasonal allergies I could not believe when I found this site and read all of the comments. I've been experiencing all of the same symptoms but never contributed them to taking Zyrtec. I've gained a lot of weight, I'm always bloated and gassy, lethargic, depressed and moody. I haven't felt myself in quite some time. A side note to this for all of the women out there, is that a lot of these symptoms are similar to those of Ovarian Cancer. My mom was recently diagnosed and had many of the symptoms we've experienced taking Zyrtec. So if you are able, please get that checked. It's called the ""silent cancer"" because it's symptoms are easily dismissed!"

1639|1640|spinal arthritis, fibromyalgia Hot flashes/sweats, constipation (controlled with Miralax), occasional sleepiness. Kadian has been effective in reducing pain, with some malingering. Previously prescribed oxycontin for more than a year and was then was switched to Kadian, 50 mg. I didn't notice a big difference in managing my pain. Also take breakthrough meds (Norco), which seem to work more effectively, but not long lasting. I also experience migraines which are controlled with generic Imitrex. Finally, I am also taking Celexa, which I feel may add to the hot flashes/sweats. The combination of meds may be exacerbating my menopausal symptoms.
1640|1641|Prostate Cancer Most common ones especially joint and muscle pain in shoulders. These symptoms are much worse with 6-month injection than with 3-month When muscle pain is real bad I can reduce it by forcing myself to relax the muscles and deep, slow breathing. Aerobic exercise helps. Running, fast cycling, and cardio machines at gym. I often don't feel like exercising but force myself to get going and the energy follows. I always feel better during and after exercise.

1651|1652|Prostate Cancer Stage 4 Some hot flashes, Muscle and joint pain and muscle weakness in legs. There are times that I can barely walk. Some back and pelvis discomfort.Weight gain (7-10 pounds), more frequent urination (worse that with the enlarged prostate), numbness in hands and fingers (I'm a pianist, and that doesn't work too well). overall lousy feeling at times, mood swings, crying at the least little thing, pain in testicles. Testicle atrophy. Breast size increase and tenderness. My head hair continues to get thicker. Wife comments on that when she cuts my hair. I had a radical prostectomy Dec 10, 2013. I was a stage 4 with a small spot in one lymph node. No cancer in the surrounding tissue. 6 month Lupron shot in Jan. then 8 weeks of external radiation starting in May. I had been a road cyclist. I continue to do up to 2 hours per day on a stationary bike and tread mill, plus weight training. PSA at 69 pre surgery PSA was at 0.2 after surgery Went on Lupron and PSA is now &lt;0.010, and holding at 0. Post Lupron Testosterone was at 27.78, starting to rise and is at 45.28. That's twice what they want. We are switching to a 4 month shot to try and relieve the side effects. There is concern about the rise in testosterone, however my PSA stays at &lt;0.010. I've been on Calcium and VitD and brought my levels up. If it weren't for the side effects, I would recommend Lupron. However my Quality of Life sucks. My Urologist ask If I would consider an Orchiectomy rather than Lupron. After much study, I decided that that would be the best option for me. Fewer bad side effects, And Peace Of Mind about further return of the cancer, if Lupron stop working. Decided to try a 4 month shot and see how it goes. If I'm still feeling as lousy, I'm going to continue with the Bilateral Orchiectomy. Complete body CT Scan Dec. 2014, and that will tell us if there is any other soft tissue involvement. My latest bone scan, clean, no spread to my bones. So to hold all this in tact, we may continue on with the Orchiectomy.

1657|1658|Depression This drug is TOXIC. STAY WAY. I took it for depression and it worked well. HOWEVER. The withdrawals are horrendous. Brain zaps like electric shocks, severe aggression and irritability, flu like symptoms, and at times self harm as the aggression would turn inward. This drug should be banned from the PBS. I am still suffering withdrawals after a month, although the physical symptoms have almost gone, I now feel depressed but I wonder if it's from the horrendous physical withdrawals. I just hope it hasn't caused me permanent brain damage. In my experience over 30 years of taking various anti-depressants SSRI's are toxic. Doctors are always praising their glory as they say there is less side effects. But this is not true unless your happy having insomnia every night and shoving more Valium into your system in order to go to sleep and this results in having to take more and more since lower doses no longer work. If you want a crappy sex life hence contributing to additional problems in your relationships go ahead. Never again!! Yes the old tricyclics also have side effects such as dry mouth and slight weight gain but at least you sleep and your relationship is in tact. Never will I take SSR's again! 😡

1662|1663|diagnosed with bipolar 50 lb weight gain. Akathesia, constipation, suicidal thoughts, depression, restlessness, Abilify is a horrible drug and did nothing for me but harm. What it does is cause a whole host of extremely undesirable side effects (as well as make drug companies very rich, as do all antipsychotics.) Given my years of experience with antipsychotics I have come to despise them because of their inefficacy to provide any substantial benefit, what they do is completely numb emotions and cause mental states like apathy and also suicidal ideations, they are also effective at sedation and taking away a persons will to live. I also philosophically do not believe the current mental health model because its all geared towards making a profit at the cost of the livelihoods of patients. It is all a shameful scam and if you have a choice you should all-together avoid the system. Do so at all costs for your own well-being.

1714|1715|Body Dysmorphic Disorder Fatigue, AWFUL withdrawal not even 36 hours after missed dose (severe headache, severe nausea, severe fatigue, brain zaps, vertigo, confusion, dizziness... honestly feels like I'm dying of a horrible flu) This was the first antidepressant that ever worked on me. I spent a good year of my life happier than I have ever been. Antidepressants I tried before this included Zoloft (which gave me heart palpitations... terrifying), Prozac, and Wellbutrin. My main reason for starting meds was BDD, but I also had been diagnosed with chronic depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and ADHD. It ended up helping a lot with the depression aspect rather than BDD, but it did get rid of the obsessive thoughts and actions that came with BDD. Still have a distorted body image, though, but I was a lot less depressed about thinking I am deformed if that makes any sense. It's been a year, though. I believe that I may be going through a relapse. My dosage will be raised as soon as I next visit my psychiatrist, but I will update this as soon as I notice anything.

My mood swings are probably one of the two biggest problems along with me never being able to stop bleeding unless I take the combined pill? Which again makes me more moody, and when I say moody, I mean MOODY I tend to snap at everything anybody says which had ruined a few relationships with people I care about. I also have a terrible time sleeping, I can be so so tired but my body just won't go to sleep and I will be tossing and turning all night or I can be not tired at all and my body just seems to fall asleep when it has the chance, this has effected work and my social life! I also eat a lot at unnecessary times such as 11:00 pm - 12:00 am. I had also had a phantom pregnancy which was pretty scary but at least I got to stop bleeding for a couple weeks! Wow one word to anyone who is thinking about getting one, DONT! The only reason I haven't got it out is because I'm scared of the method the get it out ha! dont make my mistake.

1733|1734|Severe Neck and Back Pain/Injuries Constipation resolved with stool softener/laxative. I was injured in 2000 and again in 2008. I am 38 years old and I have severe neck and back pain which basically took my life away from me. I have been on many medications and tons of Physical Therapy and chiropractic work. Nothing gave me as much relief that I get from Kadian. I also take it with Amrix (one nightly) and have Norco 10 for breakthrough pain. Since starting the Kadian, there has been a HUGE increase in my activity. I can walk around the block twice or ride my bike for about 20 minutes. I still have breakthrough pain, however, not near the pain I've been in for so many years. I can sleep through the night without pain waking me up any longer. I also don't notice much drowsiness as I did with other medications, however, the constipation is no fun. I took a laxative/stool softener nightly with no luck x 4 days. I finally drank MOM. Nothing. Drank MOM the next night and ohhhhhh let me tell ya...major incontinence on my way to work the next evening! Oh my gosh what a horror! So...I use the stool softener/laxative but will stay away from the MOM! All that said, I feel that my doctor has given me my life back by prescribing me Kadian and Amrix. Thanks Doc!

Weaning off was not as bad as I expected, but I went slow. My Dr told me nothing about side effects, which really was annoying, had to Internet search for answers, refused to take more than 10 mg. Gained 40 lbs, feel like I lost a year of my life. I highly recommend looking at other options before going down this road, and find a good doctor....Turns out a drug I was taking for heartburn caused my anxiety in the first place. So unnecessary!

I had relief of some mdd and ppd symptoms within 24 hours. Saved my life. That is all. Do not give up. 20 mg with talk therapy. Upped to 30 or 40 once, same side effects but more dumbed down, slow, emotionally less which at the time was fine when severe mdd or ppd. But i like feelings so 20 mg with talk therapy. Only had side effects initally or if i forgot for a few days or changed dose.

1760|1761|migraines Lost my hair!!!memory loss!! No migraines.
1761|1762|Migraines Tingling in fingers. Hair loss so I went off the Topamax but then the chronic headaches came back. Word loss. Initial weight loss of 70 lbs due to feeling full and I used it to my advantage because I needed to lose the weight. I also lost all taste for alcohol. Haven't had any desire to drink in over 3-1/2 yrs. drank regularly all my life before Topamax. When I noticed the hair loss I stopped taking Topamax but had to go back on it because of the chronic migraines. The Topamax seems to really work for me as far as the migraines. The only other thing that works for my migraines is not legal in my stupid state. (MJ). So I will be taking the Topamax until they get smart and legalize it. Fortunately for me the loss of words isn't terrible. Tingling has pretty much subsided except when cold. I've kept the weight off but had to work at it. Hair loss doesn't seem to be so bad. The headaches are way worse than most anything because mine are the kind that don't totally dibilitate but last 2 to 3 weeks. My job is reading and reviewing files all day long. You can't do that when your head hurts and all you want to do is go home and sleep so it's Topamax for me cause they tell me there's nothing else. I can't take pain meds during the day because I fall asleep at my desk. Besides they don't really get rid of the pain - maybe for 10-20 min.

1768|1769|Heart palpitations Terrible anxiety, irrational fears, iatrogenic illness that lasted for over a decade. This drug worked beautifully. At first, then it became a nightmare. Don't take it. Don't let anyone you care about take it. Please. This is a mind-altering, highly addictive drug that changes the way your body calms itself down. So much so, that you may never be the same, even if you stop taking it. NEVER stop this drug 'cold turkey'. It is dangerous and can lead to a very painful withdrawal syndrome that can last years.

Trouble sleeping at night but never during the day I started the meds my senior year of high school because of college choosing and working and whatever other problems high school caused (a lot). After about 6 months I stopped taking the meds but I recently started them back up. Doctor said 25 mg doesn't really do anything it just gets you started the first week by the way. I still get paranoid about things (mostly about boyfriend stuff even though it's going great for a year) have trouble talking to people I don't know (I dont) hoping one day to wake up and not be so scared of life. Currently I'm not in college and don't have a job. Don't be me. Get help before it's too late.
1771|1772|"Anxiety Decreased sex drive I suffered from general anxiety, hypochondria and intrusive thoughts for several years. I gave Celexa a try several years ago and didn't fin that it worked for me. I finally suffered a mental breakdown in October of 2013. I began cognitive therapy and 50 mg of Zoloft and feel much better. I had paralyzing obsessive thought patterns that left me feeling completely hopeless. Right off the bat, Zoloft made me feel like I could finally breathe again. I still get intrusive thoughts, but I am able to move past them without obsessing. Hypochondria has decreased in a massive way. General anxiety is much easier to deal with. No negative side effects other than decreased sex drive, which has gotten better with time. I don't feel as if I am ""on"" any sort of drug when I take it, and even if I take it a little bit later than normal one day, I don't feel any sort of withdrawal other than a slight mental jitteriness. All medications work differently for each person, and I'm glad that I found the one that allows me to live my life normally."

Also have had some ringing in ears and a clicking sound with some ear pressure. I have had a number of symptoms for some time that I didn't think to attribute to Zyrtec as it is now OTC and my physician recommended it for seasonal allergies and sinus pressure. After reading a lot of these other posts I'm realizing it may be the Zyrtec causing them, especially the vertigo I've recently experienced. I am going to try a gradual withdrawal to see what subsides and what ensues.

I set up equipment at Pharmaceutical Trade Shows and have talked to the reps from Cephalon. They have two more formulas in the Pipe Line. One is like the instant disolve breathe sheets and the other is suger-free. Since switching to Duragesic, I'm doing better than ever. Between the patch and Vicoprofen, I can manage my pain with less problems. Everyone is different, so I won't pass judgement on some of the other comments seen here. I would suggest that people still taking Actiq wait until they are off the medication before giving an opinion. You don't realize how much the drug changes your personality until you are off of it. After 9 years of managing my pain and handicap, I can offer a pearl of wisdom. Accept your pain and your life the way it is now. You'll never get anywhere hoping to return to your former life. For most of us, there is no cure. Also, stop thinking that the drugs will take away all the pain, or

1791|1792|hbp Insomnia, lack of energy, dizziness I got off this crap very slowly using natural supplements. I am still waiting to see how much improvement I will see because my poor dependent body needs to get used to not having it anymore. But already after a week and a half, I am sleeping better, have more energy and little things are just all round getting better. I have less problems with the feeling of swelling in my mouth, My scalp does not itch near as much. I am still experiencing major tingling in my left side and in my face ever other day. Some of this might be due to the effects of the stroke I had, but things got worse the longer I was on it. They also got worse as the dosage went down and the body cried for more. So we wait and have hope that the problems will go away. I guess from what I have read that it could take a couple months to see real noticeable improvements.

1805|1806|For memory problems and anxiety Extreme tiredness, low libido Did not work for my memory problems nor my anxiety, both stayed about the same. I was on 60mg/d for a full year and then to 90 for a couple months which did nothing, so I had to wean off of it completely. Be warned that stopping Cymbalta can be very dangerous, I missed 3 doses, 3 days in a row and felt like I could have killed somebody. When I weaned off of 90mg I went to 60 and then to 30 over a course of 2 months but that is not long enough. A few days after stopping from 30mg I had very strong urges to kill myself for about a week. I knew I really didn't want to die but that didn't stop my brain from telling my body to do something about it. Luckily I have family and doctors that helped me through it. The only positive I can give this drug is that it helped me sleep when I trouble falling asleep before taking it, but it made me so sleepy that I needed a nap everyday. Now that I'm off it, I hardly ever want/need naps but my inability to fall asleep is back.

1826|1827|Broken in half by car accident At first my stomach was up set, but that faded away. I was on this drug Actiq for 2 years, until I could not pay for it anymore. And, disability refused to pay for it. The drug was good the side effects now are devistating, making me home bound because like other's I no longer have teeth. I spent 5 years in braces, first 3 through Jr. High then when my wisdom teeth came in,they had to pull them and I had to spend 2 more years in braces and while I was just about done with my retainer at 16 I had a car accident where the car rolled 5 times and I went halfway out of the sunroof the car rolled over ontop of me, broke me in half, and rolled 2 more times. While in intensive care with a resperator and no retainer my teeth all spaced out so about 8 months again in braces. Now with Chronic pain, closed head injury, back broken in 7 places, and 33 corrective surgeries since. Actiq worked good compared to other pain med's. But, now I have 7 teeth left. I am so embarassed to go out. Who would wan If I knew then what I know now, I never would have taken it. At this time my next option is a Morphine pump or shotgun. I didn't go through all the pain of wearing head grear, the throbbing of the orthodic rubber bands. The stanless steal smile as a teenage girl. Actiq did work sure, but I really would like to actually EAT SOMETHING that is solid SOON. I have no molers, both gold crowns snaped off and my last 5 on the bottom in the front are not looking so good. So, they will be next. What the HECK is a person TO DO? I sure hope that the Manufacture and Disributor get to read some of these. Being Disabled is bad enough, but the medication they give you that is suppose to help make's all your teeth fall out, is a very-VERY BAD thing. I am in Tampa, FL is there anyone out there that can help. I get $599 a month, how am I suppose to pay for the dental surgeries, extractions then dentures? HELP! Any Pro-bono Dentist's around?

Had to use it as my main pain med because all of the others I tried (methadone, oxycontin, etc) gave me severe side effects due to the amount of other medications I was taking for other problems. Now my pain doctor is getting out of the business because he can't take the political pressure and no other doctor in southwest Michigan will prescribe it. They won't give their real reason for not prescribing; they are trying to say they're afraid someone will break into your house and steal it or a child may get it but can't they get the other drugs prescribed too? Totally assinine coming from medical professionals. Let's just be honest. So now I have to use drugs that are not as effective and will probably end up back on my couch with a heating pad and of no use to anyone, not my husband, daughter or anyone else, most of all to myself.

Walking 3 miles per day didn't help stop the weight gain. I've never weighed this much in my life. I recently stopped taking it, I did a quick reduction time of taking half for one week then reducing pellets the next week, and stopped completely and have been off for three weeks. I can no longer tolerate being fat. I'm having withdrawal symptoms of brain zaps, foggy brain, crying spells/sensitivity, dizziness and diarrhea. I don't think my withdrawal symptoms are as severe as some. My appetite has dismissed significantly and I think I've dropped some weight which is encouraging.

Even when I told him that the 20 pills from the ER every 6 months or so is all I go through! 20 pills in that long amount of time and he still refuses, says he is not that kind of doctor!! ?? He has prescribed maxalt, visteril,imitrex-didn't work. He then referred me to a neuro. I went to see the neuro,brought my pills with me and he said .. ""he's not that kind of doctor""!!?? I was in tears. He has prescribed me Gabapentin , baclafen. Topamax , zanaflex and amitriptaline. Lots of side effects. Recently,he listened to me, but I think only because 20 pills last me. He was reluctant, but prescribed them. 20 pills,no refills for 4 mths I'm grateful for even that because these do work. It's a shame pills taken on a daily basis, all in the name of ""prevention"" is better to them instead of a pill to cure once and as needed.

1898|1899|Prevent second pregnancy I had the implanon put in after I gave birth in 2011 and on the plus side it prevented me from getting pregnant and I had zero periods when I had it. But that's also the downfall, I thought it was great not having any periods while on it and when it came time to take it out I still wasn't getting any. About a month after it came out I was getting light brown periods that either lasted a few days or over a week, and then I stopped having then altogether. I went on the pill to try and regulate and it worked for a little bit and then I just stopped getting them again. I had irregular periods growing up, but never like this. My husband and I had been trying to get pregnant since late 2013 and have had no luck, and it's really hard to know when you don't get a period. It helped with not getting pregnant, but totally screwed up my cycle

1903|1904|Neuropathy, OsteoArthritis Difficulty urinating is the weirdest, just have to relax and think about a waterfall. Constipation, every morning drink a liver cleansing potion of warm water, lemon juice with fresh squeezed ginger root, small splash of cayenne pepper sweeten with agauve nectar. And drink a few ounces of Aloe Vera juice every day. Really helps maintain a nicely formed stool daily nothing like that messy Miralax. If I take more than 20mgs Kadian three times a day I get uncomfortably sweaty with the least amount of exertion. Kadian works for a certain extent but get breakthough pain in my lower back and feet with no other meds for it, Doc just wants me to take more Kadian! Medicare won't pay for Skelaxin which works wonders. Sometimes get weepy &amp; morose if I sleep 2 hours past dose time which can happen at times because of the lethargy. I have tried to detox myself off but it is hard and I don't recommend it to anyone. In the end there is no perfect drug although I am going back to the Pain Clinic to see what else might help. All of our bodies react differently to pharmaceutical chemicals and I wish our Doctors would be more aware of it. This site is a great way to self-evaluate my pain needs.

1906|1907|Depression Lots of side effects! Hair loss, lowered immune function, memory problems, cognitive issues, sleep problems and urinary frequency Okay, the people that talk about these insane side effects and then say they will never stop taking it...what's the deal with that? You like your brain slowly getting shut down? You like becoming stupid? You like losing your hair? This is silly, if your problems were that bad that you can live with the above side effects along with full on mental retardation...I don't know what to say! Losing your brain but at least your whatever is controlled is a terrible trade off. For some people this stuff works great but for others it is a death sentence waiting to happen. Teva generic=100% side effects and zero benefits. This stuff nearly killed me and it's unfortunate that it didn't because what I have left to work with isn't worth it.
1907|1908|Epilepsy Lamictal has helped with the seizures but it sucks I have to be on it the rest of my life. It interferes with my sex drive, I'm always tired and now I've started having constant headaches. I'm not sure if the constant headache is due to the medicine but I'm not feeling it. Nothing really helps with the headache, I've had it a week now. I must find me a new neurologist bc this one don't care. I've been seizure free though, only had a few while I was pregnant.
1908|1909|water retention Just some shakiness if I didn't supplement my potassium level. This is a great diuretic, however it works very quickly so you need to be prepared to go to the washroom within an hour of taking it. I tend to retain water a lot, so when I take it, it works quickly. Unlike other diuretics that can keep you in the bathroom throughout the day at fairly regular intervals, I have found that Lasix works quickly (done in about 3 hours). However, keep bananas around to help supplement your potassium levels so that you don't get shaky.
1909|1910|Depression BEWARE....the generics of Lexapro are NOT all the same. They vary greatly in how effective they are. Most generics are made overseas in India or China. I had to go to three pharmacies before I could find one that did not cause serious side effects. Again, please be very careful when changing over to the generic of Lexapro. The best manufacturer I have found is Lupen.

I noticed that I would become easily upset and angry. My blood tests showed that it lowered my kidney function. I was also taking Toprol and Cozaar. The combination of drugs seem to have caused permanent kidney damage.
1913|1914|"ADHD, Depression Very much like the real thing without the smoke. If you've ever eaten pot brownies it's not unlike that. Only bad side effect is bit of crash after wears off.

I'm having bad balance problems to the point I can't go up and down stairs or even up a little stoop in front of a store without feeling like I'm going to fall, my eyes are blurry, muscle aches, extremely tired, and just the feeling of having the flu but without the related fever or stomach issues, tingling all over, I feel like shoes are on my feet when there aren't any, extremely cold hands, feet, swelling like I was stung by a bee in my hands and feet, gained weight, about 25 lbs in less then a year. Now the problem is the doctor has changed my drug, but said I need to wean myself off the tenormim which seems to be a The drug has kept my high blood pressure under control for the most part.

1942|1943|Pain, Anger, Tension, GAD NONE Valium has changed my life. Im a Police Officer and fitness enthusiast, with an extremely stressful life. Have suffered from anxiety since a teen. The repressed anger from dealing with scumbags daily and some pretty intense spinal injuries, has left me in a state of pure tension and uneasyness. Valium totally erases all of my issues. I have increased my dose from 5mg to 15mg over two years. But occassionally i will go a week only taking 10mg a day. The key is abstaining from alcohol. Alcohol +Valium = BAD. Stay very hydrated and exercise. The name brand is much better than the generic. If you have insurance, tell doc u want name brand only. If you are uninsured, youll have to stick with generic because the name brand costs $575.00 for 60 pills without insurance. I will take valium indefinitely. The quality of life improvement outweighs the only negative factor of valium, which would be coming off of it.

1946|1947|Birth Control - Went from an A cup to a C - plenty of weight gain - depression/anxiety/guilty feelings The pill does what it's supposed to, I've been sexually active with my boyfriend for around a year and a half and never worried about pregnancy. I've decided to tough out the side effects because it's worth it... But don't get me wrong they do suck. I miss having motivation to do things and being happy without forcing it.

I became incredibly ill while taking this pill and doctors could not figure out why. I was constantly getting sick while on Yaz, although I had been healthy before. I was always tired, had severe stomach problems, anxiety attacks, and depression. I could barely work out and if I did my muscles would hurt. It took me a YEAR to recover from the horrible side-effects of this pill once I came off. I did however, notice vast improvements within 2 DAYS of stopping the pill! DO NOT TAKE! This pill is poison.
1948|1949|depression and anxiety EXTREME weight gain. Being tired all the time. No motivation or energy. I have been on this medication for about two years. For the first year and a half the anxiety was almost non existent but because of the extreme weight gain (46 pounds) I was even more depressed and have zero self esteem. The medication wore off but instead of upping my dose I switched to a new medication because of the weight gain. Keep in mind since I noticed the weight gain I have been eating a lot healthier and exercising more and I still continued to pack on the pounds. Some people gain some people lose. My side effects were just very unfortunate.
1949|1950|"Depression/Anxiety Memory Loss, Cognitive difficulty Zoloft changed my life for the better. Before Zoloft I had a difficult time communicating my thoughts and feelings. I would get so upset and frustrated all the time because nobody understood me. I was unable to maintain work relationships and I got fired from multiple jobs due to my behavior. I was very emotional and angry. My family loved me , but hurt inside because they couldn't figure out how to help me and why I was so unhappy. After a life changing event in my life I decided to try Zoloft. I had been on Flueoxetine, Effexor and tried other anti-depressants, but nothing works for me like Zoloft. Prozac had my emotions so high and so low I went from ""extremes"" I was neither here or there I was either too happy or very sad I drove people nuts. People thought I was bi-polar with my mood swings. Zoloft has my moods so stable I have been able to maintain relationships with people. I now have a boyfriend for 2 years and can proudly say I have maintained my job for almost 3 years. That says a lot about this drug. I owe it all to this because I knew I was a good person and had good intentions I just needed some help. I struggled before and my family struggled for me too. I am glad I don't have to see them hurt anymore and I feel great. I know it's working for me and I have to do what's best for me and that's all that matters. If that means being on this medication for the rest of my life, that's what I'll do..."

There are times it feels less effective, so I go off of it for 3/4 days, then start again.

1964|1965|Chronic low back leg and nerve pain Occaisonal constipation which is manageable. I have had great results with this medication. I have been in pain from a back injury/surgery for almost 18 years. In reading the comments I noticed that the word addiction and addictive was used very frequently. I believe there is a major misunderstanding of this word. Within the chronic pain community as well as within the general public. Addiction is an aberrent psychological condition where one beleives they must have this drug and would do anything to obtain the drug. Dependency is when a persons body becomes dependent upon the drug and one will suffer physical withgraw sysmptoms should the drug be stopped abruptly. I am dependent on actiq just as I have been dependent on the morphine, oxycodin, and methodone that I have taken to control my pain. Remove the pain and I do not need these drugs. If you are addicted the pain is of no consequence. You require the drug to satisfy your addiction, not to control your pain. Far too many people are labled with the word addict when the real

1968|1969|ADD dry mouth i have been taking this for 3 years for adult add it really helps me concentrate and get motivated i do not get any rush from this drug as a matter of fact i can take a nap while on it my appetite is less while taking adderall but this is fine since i am overweight i asked the doctor if i could try a higher dose but because of my age and that i was doing well he wanted to leave it alone i did go off it for about 3 months only because i was too lazy to get back to the doctor for a prescription must get a new prescription each time no problem going off it no side effects i have had no problem with this drug

1972|1973|ADHD achy joints jaw insomnia terrible crashing effect by early evening when i was in elementary school my teachers told my parents that i desperatly needed riddalin but my parents refused to put me on drugs and encouraged my teachers to use alternative methods to hold my attention i did okay in school but in my senior year of college i started adderallxr and i became an a student i m in graduate school now in large part because of adderall i work hard to use other methods to keep focused although my rx needs to increase every now and then
1973|1974|ADHD (non-hyperactive; ADD) dry mouth anxiety susceptiblilty to hypoglycemia severe loss of appetite i would recommend taking adderall if you need it i had a rough couple first weeks testing different doses and such i m on the highest prescribed dose for adderall xr it helps me function in my college classes with exceptional ability i highly reccommend eating before taking as i could hardly look at food let alone eat while i am on adderall this substance can be highly addictive so i routinely wean on the weekends which means i simply don t take it this method also helps greatly when it comes to effectiveness and extremity of side effects parents do not let your young under 16 children have possession of the entire prescription as they may have issues in taking it also parents help your kids understand why they want to take it not why the doctor says they should adhd may sound like it will make them an outsider also just a helpful hint to all you teenagers my age don t drink or smoke marijuana while you are taking adderall it s not the kind of high you wou
1974|1975|migraine and vertigo Sleepiness Works well to deter nausea, I can usually get away with taking 1/4 to 1/2 of a 25mg pill to avoid the worst of the drowsiness but it'll definitely knock you out at higher doses. As an added bonus it seems to help with the confusion and anxiety that I sometimes get with migraines.
1975|1976|Chronic hives/dermagraphism knocks me out tired even the next day very hungry leads to weight gain all this aside it s the only medication that works on my hives i ve stopped taking it daily and now cut the 25mg pill in half and take when i start to itch which helps with the drowsiness so i can function but still very tired will ask my dr if i can get a lower dosage on refill taking it twice a day did not help frequency or severity of outbreaks so i now take only at first sign of itching i have not found it to prevent hives only satiate them
1976|1977|osteopena Nausea, teeth pain resulting in implants, flu symptoms, overall lethargics, pain and depression Doctors pushing this drug. Horrible side effects. Am stopping this drug immediately because I am afraid it is ruining my health.
1977|1978|Hypertension right from the start I experienced dizziness and nausea as well as insomnia My Doctor advised that this is all in my head and to keep taking the medication. For 3 years, I suffered 20 lbs weight gain, dizziness, burning sensation on face and neck, extreme muscle pain and joint pains, depression , constipation, nightmares, chest pain , difficulty breathing and pain in lungs and throat. I finally had enough and weened of the drug slowly but the chest pains and burning in my lungs is still there and I also have a severe shortness of breath and fatigue to the point that making my bed puts me down for at least an hour. I also started irregular heartbeats and pounding heartbeats at times after I stopped this medication. BEWARE AND DON'T TAKE BYSTOLIC. this drug needs to be taken of the market and the company should be sued.
1978|1979|Blood Pressure, BPH, ED Mild headaches when I first went on it. Excedrin for Migraines or Advil took care of them. Some initial nasal stuffiness, especially after ejaculating. A decongestant taken ahead of time helped with that. If you stop taking the medicine and later restart it, your body will have to adjust to it again. You will have the headaches and nasal congestion again. After I went on blood pressure medicine, I had trouble getting and maintaining erections. Then, I became Diabetic, too. Both my GP and my Urologist suggested going on Cialis. It has been a huge help! In addition to helping with erections, it has helped greatly with urination. I have reduced urge during the day, and only get up once per night. Recently, my GP switched me from Diovan HCT to Losartan for blood pressure and my erections are stronger yet. I read somewhere that Losartan can be helpful to male Diabetics who experience ED. I now often wake up in the morning with full erections. Daily walking (or other form of exercise) helps, too. Hope Cialis helps others, too!
1979|1980|Peripheral neuropathy Excessive weight gain, foggy head in morning, dizzy. Although Cymbalta helped with my pain, I had the Dr wean me off because of the side effects. It gets depressing going to the gym and eating less while you gain weight. I hope the weight goes off as quick as it went on.
1980|1981|Major Depression Not sure if side effects were from this medicine or others (Niasin and Zetia for high cholesterol), but I had dry mouth. I was still depressed, and I don't know if it was working. When I forgot to take a dose on time, I had nausea. I went through a difficult divorce and had a lot of other big changes in my life (moving to different house, starting a new business, money issues), but I was still very depressed so I didn't think meds were helping. I stopped taking Cymbalta when I had skipped a dose and was too busy to deal with the nausea. I didn't really intend to stop taking it, but I didn't want to deal with the nausea so I just never took it again. Didn't notice any difference for at least a month. But then I went through more stress, moved again, downsized my business, had staffing problems, no family or close friends nearby, etc. Two months after stopping med, I had extreme memory and disorientation problems. That is getting better because I don't have as much on my mind now, but I can't concentrate, am very lonely and depressed and confused. I have a lot of bad crying jags and feelings of homelessness and fear of the future. I might go back on it, but when I moved 4 months ago, I never finished unpacking and now I can't find my meds so I would need to get a new prescription, but it is so hard to get an apt to see a Dr. I am just generally confused and can't make decisions. I feel like there is no one I can depend on, and no one would notice if I disappeared.

2004|2005|For my blood pressure and edema My doctor Prescribed Dyazide and Norvasc to control my blood pressure and the swelling in my legs and feet.According to the medical dictionary Norvasc causes swelling in the legs.I haven't question my doctor about this but I intend to.I have also become sexually disfunctional.My Urologist prescribe Cialis,but it has no get effect on me I think that the drug would work better if the doctor would suggest a proper diet for the patient or a list of meals that you can choose from that will not increase you sodium intake and lower your blood pressure.
2005|2006|"Major Depression, Bipolar Where do I start??? My psychiatrist started me on 150 MG of this back in 2013 after a suicide attempt landed me in a psych ward. I've been on antidepressants since I was 13 &amp; trust me, this drug works! And it started working pretty fast for me. It still works after all this time. But...I feel as though I've sold my soul to the devil with this drug. See, my psychiatrist back in 2013 failed to mention to me that if I ever try to come off this drug, I might literally die. I've dealt with withdrawal symptoms from MANY other antidepressants including Zoloft &amp; Seroquel. Those symptoms were a walk in the park compared to Effexor withdrawal! Long story short, I lost my job &amp; lost my health insurance so I could no longer see my psychiatrist without paying cash for the visit. I begged &amp; pleaded with her office to give me a refill &amp; I will pay for it by borrowing cash. She refused. I was forced into withdrawal &amp; it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had painful brain zaps, diarrhea, the 1st migrane of my life, I was throwing up....but that wasn't the worst! I had homocidal thoughts! I felt like a shaking, sweating, monster! I couldn't even focus my eyes on anything so driving became a hassel. I was SO angry which isn't like me at all. And I couldn't stop crying. I ended up in the ER again. Awful! I am completely TERRIFIED of ever losing this drug &amp; going through that again. After feeling those horrific withdrawal symptoms last year, I had my now dr switch me to the lowest dose in the hopes that I can maybe come off it easier after suffering hallucinations. I attempted to take out a few beads of my capsules daily for 2 weeks, when the withdrawal symptoms came back &amp; made me feel homocidal again. I don't know how I will ever be ""normal"" without this drug. Some other side effects I have are I can't orgasm like I used to. That &amp; I feel like I could laugh at a funeral all the time."
2006|2007|Depression. dry mouth caused my teeth to decay completely sexual side effects i could achieve an orgasm but no ejaculation also the orgam was premature only taking about 2 minutes it seemed to increase my appetite and caused me to sleep a lot did not work for me as an antidepressant i take wellbutrin and effor now and after 30 years of trying things this combo works for me

2028|2029|Seizures Irritability, moodiness, anger (worse with dose increases, affecting my family). Also night sweats, difficulty concentrating, lack of motivation, dry and itchy skin, dry (damaged, breaking) hair. Not quite depression, but not really happy or fining joy in things. Have not had a grand mal on it but think I have had some infrequent partials. Changing to another med now due to loss of quality of life (irritability, anger). Tried adding B complex vitamin and fish oil. Helped mood a little but no where near enough. Did not help dry skin. Not tired on it or confused but now realizing some memory issues. Weight neutral for me (though lack of motivation makes me exercise less).
2029|2030|Bipolar II with psychosis Drowsiness, stiff neck, occasional itching, constipation, weight gain. This medication has been the only one that consistently has worked for me since I have been diagnosed. I have had to add other medications at times when I was going through seasonal mood changes, but overall this has been enough. My biggest complaint would have been the drowsiness. But after sometime my doctor decided since it was hard for me to wake up and take it in the morning and not be drowsy, I take my entire dose at night before I go to sleep. That way I sleep through it and it helps me fall asleep. I have always had a bad back, but this medication definitely increased the pain. Sometimes it feel like it is too much to bare so I am looking into getting a massage therapist still. Constipation I have struggled with too most of my life and this medication increased that also. I would have to take a laxative once a week to have a bowel movement. Now that I changed my diet, I started juicing veggies and I take stool softeners, it is almost regular again. I cut out dairy products too. The weight gain was really hard to deal with. From when I started taking the medication, I gained about 25 lbs. my weight fluxiates quite a bit. I am only 15 lbs over my starting weight right now. It just makes me feel hungry all the time. Even if my stomach feels like it is going to burst I still want to eat. It has been hard trying to overcome that. But you just have to look at it this way, is it better to be medicated, feel almost normal and have side effects, or live being ridiculously emo

2031|2032|depression and anxiety Yawning, dry mouth, restless legs at night, waking up in the middle of the night, decreased sex drive I wake up almost every night between the hours of 1 and 4 no matter what time I take the medication or go to bed. I usually have a hot feeling in my legs. It takes between 10 minutes to 1 hour to fall back asleep even though I feel tired. The medication, despite my poor sleep, is extremely effective in treating my depression and anxiety.
2032|2033|IBS, Insomnia sexual dysfunction slow at first but got worse as i kept taking it and continued on for a long time after i stopped it helped me sleep and relaxed my stomach but the doctor of course didn t tell me about the sexual side effects they didn t happen right away but continued long after i stopped inability to sustain an erection for a long time hard time ejaculating decreased sensitivity etc
2033|2034|Back Pain happyness, from both the pain relief and the up lifting effect the drug has. Better eye sight. I went from 20/20 to 20/10 at 37 years old and my family has a history of eye problems short term memory loss I was badly injured at my job. It took me a year and a half to walk normaly again and have 24hour pain now 10 years after the accident. I did not take any perscriptions for my pain for almost 6 years. I recently (3 years ago) started back on opiods and was given Marinol several months later to counter act the side effects. I stopped taking the opiods and just kept taking the Marinol. At 2.5mg I could drive and funtion quite normaly it would lower my daily pain (2 to 5) 2 points, from 2 to 0 or from a 5 to a 3. When my pain was up around a 7 a 10mg Marinol would lower it to a 2 but I would not drive on a 10mg dose. I believe that this should be next to asprin at the super market. I see a very low chance of abuse (as do most experts) and its only because of this drugs heritage that it is not freely avalable as other perscriptions that are now over the counter.

So I only take then when I crawl into bed. I fall asleep in about 45 minutes and get a great nights sleep. I wake up feeling great and take my tramadol in the morning to help with my pain. I don't see how anyone could operate on this medication. Best used at bedtime. Also I stopped this for 9 months why I was pregnant, no withdraw.... Really Helps Me!!!

I was a little foggy for the first couple months but nothing I couldn't deal with after what I had been thru with all the headaches. Think the trick is to be on the lowest possible dose. My Dr started me on just one tablet for 6 months and that was plenty. I have heard some go to two tabs right of the bat ...took a bit for the body to get used to.

2053|2054|Anxiety,Panic Attacks,Agoraphobia Basically none, only if I'm really, really tired, then it makes me just a bit sleepy. It has really helped me with my anxiety and panic attacks.It makes me feel normal.I dont actually take it ever day,rather on per needed basis,since June 2013.Was taking them back in 2000 with much higher dose for very bad panic attacks (3-4 times 0.5mg a day),but with careful dose reduction,had absolutely no problem with stopping,and extremely minor withdrawal symptoms,almost none.And it helped me immensely,then,and it helps me now. Bit of a warning,though:don't try to quit cold turkey,rather ask your doctor for recommended dose reduction,and you'll have no problems with withdrawal.Also,try to avoid any advices given by Heather Ashton,as her method is very flawed,and such pointless long tapering can only bring more harm. Remember:Trust your doctor and trust yourself.Listen to relaxing music,try to find someone you can confide in (girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife/parents/good friend),it's very hard if you have to keep your feelings to yourself,at least try to write them down. This is important:during panic attack,yoour mind is trying to tell you something,try to listen to it,as hard as that may seem. And if you believe in God,say a prayer once in a while,He will help you. God bless.
2054|2055|birth control Frequent leg cramps, severely low libido, vaginal dryness, tender breasts, PCOS, Hypothyroidism, Hormonal imbalance, pituitary problems, lactation, chronic yeast infections, painful intercourse. Yaz ruined my life because it caused all the problems I have. I was only on it for three years and I had to stop. I gained 50 pounds and my body is a hormonal mess because it upped the testosterone production, among other things. It made me hyperthyroid, which no one has in my family. I had SEVERE LEG CRAMPS while on YAZ and felt so depressed. Then I started to get chronic yeast infections, which to this day doctors can't explain and said it was all in my head when I mentioned that sex was severely painful. I felt like someone was literally stabbing the inside of my vagina
2055|2056|Depression I was originally prescribed 25 mg by my psych. I stayed on that dosage for a month and did not see any improvement in my overall mood/outlook or depression. My PCD suggested I increase the dosage to 50mg and then to 75mg (if needed) over the course of a month. Talk about night and day difference! 75mg must have been the sweet spot- I no longer questioned the meaning of life, and began to find beauty in the day-to-day like I had as a child. I am now so happy, and look back on that period with sadness- Thank the Lord I was encouraged by friends and family to seek help through a SSRI's. Praise God for medacine
2056|2057|"mid to latent alzheimer's Gradual increase in rate, intensity and frequency of the following: irritability, irrational throughts, violent outbursts, argumentative, chronic EXPLOSIVE diarrhea, insomnia, fatigue, nightmares (he reports never remembering a dream in his life prior to taking medication), loss of appetite, childish mood swings, apathy, no understanding of hygiene (was meticulous about hygiene prior to taking) I am writing this for my dad who is 75 years old. He was diagnosed with alzheimer's 3.5 years ago. His functional abilities were limited, at best. He suffered from five mini strokes within the same time frame. My dad has always been irrational and explosive, never cared to know the date or time of day, and when asked about who is president, has answered incorrectly his entire life. His physician diagnosed and prescribed based on questions like this. 5mg aricept for two weeks, then to 10mg--he has taken now for 3.5 years. He was also prescribed Namenda, Zoloft, and plavix. I thought this combination of meds was miraculous until the past six months. Prior to diagnosis, his behavior was severely explosive, hallucinating, ""sundowners"", and essentially could not dress himself or get out of his chair. Immediately upon taking the meds, he appeared to regain 70% of his functionality, began to be involved in life again. For the past six months (and more likely, gradually upon taking med), mood swings are more frequent, irrational-bordering violent-extremely irritable/argumentative, complains about everything (frequent complaints were characteristic of him, but this is unbearable),basically hates life and everything about it, AND has chronic,EXPLOSIVE episodes of diarrhea-usually not making it to the bathroom.As his primary caregiver, and after reading these comments, we are DCing the aricept tonight.I will re-post the results of this trial within one week.I deperately hope"

2066|2067|Alzheimers Hallucinations My mother is 96 and has late stage. Her behavior is usually terrible. About a month ago her perscription ran out. Since her doctor was moving and I'd heard it really doesn't help late stage patients, I skipped it for a couple months. She's been back on it 4 days now and is having very strong hallucinations again and has been doing this for around 8 hours now. I just realized this wasn't nearly as bad during the period when she was off the drug. I am wondering if the last 4 years of her life have been made even more miserable because of it and also why I was never warned about side effects. Does it somehow counter-act the Namenda she takes to calm her down?

I have been very happy on Baclofen for over 4 years. Just in the last few months my spasms are creeping back. I now have lower back spasms and the top of both hips. My shoulders and neck are hard as a rock. I am discussing this with Dr. next appointment.
2068|2069|Chronic migraines None really, but I have a sneaky suspicion that it decreases my metabolism a bit. And I noticed that it will limit my heart rate during cardio - guessing by about 10bpm. Huge affect on control of migraines. Used to have 2-3 migraines a week, now down to 2-3 a month. And it reduced my blood pressure a bit, which was good, since I was on a little too high (135/85).

2070|2071|Fibromyalgia I had to stop using it because I was diagnosed with Bipolar and was taking to other medications that had Serotonin in them causing be Serotonin Storm. It was fine before taking two other medications with Serotonin in them. Cymbalta worked great for Fibromyalgia. It was nice to be able to swim again because my skin wasn't sensitive to the cold. I was disappointed when I had to quit taking it. But I had to make a choice which was worse the Bipolar or Fibromyalgia.
2071|2072|Birth Control serious weight gain loss of sex drive bloating what i can best describe as a false pregnancy almost at first i loved this drug i liked that i didn t have periods on it it s very inexpensive and you only have to think about it once every 3 months however in the 4 years i was on it i gained 40 lbs and i have no doubt it was the depo s fault not only did i gain weight it was impossible to lose until i went off of it even with dieting and exercise i went from a size 5 to a 12 which is just ridiculous i had absolutely no sex drive so if that s the birth control it offers lol the once a month bloating was terrible made my jeans fit even tighter thus depressing me the final straw was the pregnancy symptoms i got breast tenderness mood swings and morning sickness i wasn t pregnant but i sure felt it i d never recommend this to anyone it also depreciates the calcium in bones which i think is reason enough to have it pulled off the market since it is for women i now take orthocyclen skipping the placebo spacer week as directed by my ob gyn so i still don t have periods i have none of the side effects i had with depo and have finally started to lose the weight i put on

2076|2077|prevent pregnancy mood swings no period hey not having a period was great depo provera was the first birth control that i ever took and i was on it for 4 years until my doctor recommended i switch to something else to avoid bone loss i didn t gain any weight i actually lost some i was super moody for the first 5 months or so but then i became normal again as my body adjusted but now i have been off it for 2 years and my periods are still irregular and really short 1 2 days and light it does kind of worry me a little i haven t tried to get pregnant yet but i ve heard of some women having problems getting pregnant after the shot
2077|2078|birth control and no more periods no periods no bleeding no mess no fuss no bloating no mood swings no pain and no interruptions for vacations swimming sex exercising happy i had started taking depo 4 years ago then read some of the horror stories and even though i was having no bad side effects i stopped and immediately my life long horror story of heavy bleeding for 3 weeks with pain that would keep me in bed for at least 2 days then maybe i would get a 1 week reprieve before it would all happen again so i talked to my doctor and stared back on it and couldn t be happier i know drugs react differently to different people but i also see a pattern in the women with bad side effects that most of them are in their early 20 s and have been on it for sometime
2078|2079|birth control weight gain i loved depo i was on it for four years and the only side effect i had was weight gain of about 15 lbs i had no periods but mild spotting occassionally when i went off off it i was able to get pregnant about a year later with no problems i highly recommend it
2079|2080|Birth control none for the record i think that most of the woman complaining about depo are insane depo will not cause you to gain over 100 lbs not eating right and not excercising for years did that it will not give you toe fungus or any of the other crazy side effects that some of the woman have listed depo has been wonderful to me its a long term way for my husband and i to not get pregnant no side effects no weight gain no crazy unrelated horror stories at all very few people have ill reactions to this and other medications for most of us this is a great birth control that you only have to think about 4 times a year it completely stops you from having any periods or pms and everything associated with a period i love it and so does everyone that i ve ever known that has been on it
2080|2081|Birth control i had horrible periods before getting on depo i would throw up for a week straight every month because my cramps were intolerable after my second dose of depo i no longer had a period and i have felt 100 better yes you do have occasional mood swings but i believe that totally out ways the difficulties of being a parent at a young age i suggest depo to all of my friends that are having trouble with other types if birth control nan

2088|2089|"Migraines/ Menstrual Cramps Euphoria, the urge to buy stuff (especially on the internet), drowsiness, irritability after a few hours. This stuff usually works for my migraines, which can get really bad. The key is to take it early on in the migraine. Sometimes I need 2, but usually 1 does the trick. This stuff also works well for really bad menstrual cramps. I find that I have a decrease in patience several hours after taking it and can be more easily irritated and snappy. Also I stay away from stores because I have a strong urge to buy stuff that is ""so useful""."
2089|2090|Rheumatoid Arthritis swelling redness itching at the injection site for first 6 months only been amazing for controlling my ra had for 13 5 yrs taken in conjunction with methotrexate my consultant now says i am in remission has given me back a great deal of independence

2091|2092|Crohn's lymphoma my son was just diagnosed with t cell non hodgkins lymphoma with a guarded prognosis it was explained this was most likely a result of his 4 year use of 150 mg of imuran daily worked great on the crohn s but is it worth the risk

2093|2094|Chronic Back Pain Severe constipation cured by diet and Miralax, Cotton mouth - drink lots of water and sugarfree gum Drowsiness - keep going and let body adjust NO HIGHS which is important to me. The pain JUST disappears. Hydrocodone 5-mg/350-mg for break thru pain. Not all doctors know how to prescribe pain med's. I worked with a pain specialist (Voted Best Pain Dr.) to find what worked for me and what didn't. Kadian much better than pain patches for me! I've had to increase the amount over time but this amount is working for me. I'm not pain free but I now have a life.
2094|2095|Depression/Anxiety Dry skin, lethargy I am very pleased with this med. I feel more mentally and physically calm when I take it. Racing thoughts and irritability are greatly reduced. I do feel more lethargic, but I can overcome it with a little effort. Not much antidepressant effect for me, but the reduction in anxiety probably helps indirectly.
2095|2096|anxiety, depression difficulty ejaculating, reduction in sex drive, reduction in sexual pleasure, needed to take daily naps several hours long, slightly reduced emotions, inability to get a tear in my eye when I'm happy I originally took Paxil and switched to Lexapro. Their side effects are the same. It was supposed to help with anxiety, but I had anxiety and panic attacks like crazy on this stuff. My sex life with my NEW wife was badly effected for 10 years. We just don't have sex anymore. I got tired everyday and needed to sleep for hours... if I needed to stay awake (work) I would be very uncomfortable and would not perform well. This medication messed up my life and I'm glad to finally be off it. Find an alternative to SSRIs if you value your sex life.

2099|2100|Migraines None I can't say enough about this medicine for my migraines. I take a pill at the onset of a migraine and within one hour, the migraine is usually always gone! Amazing med with no side effects...and I have tried many other rescue meds before this which had side effects for me.
2100|2101|Ulcerative colitis i was diagnosed in 2001 with u c and was managed with asacol and rowasa at times i eventually started flaring more often requiring prednisone each flare it took longer for the prednisone to work and my doctor highly recommended i start remicade i was hesitant and waited a few months until i had 2 flares close together i started remicade in november 2009 and had immediate results the first thing i noticed was that my very painful and frequent abdominal cramps disappeared my first treatment gave me a significant headache but beyond that i don t have any side effects i do have achy joints but i know that goes along with u c i ve also gained about 15 pounds since starting my treatment remicade changed my life for the better and i wouldn t give it up i don t have to know where all of the public restrooms are or worry about multiple bathroom breaks at work or wonder if my latest meal with punish me nan

2103|2104|sleep aid I do seem to have headaches the day after I take a serax. Not sure if it is related to serax tho. I try to only take them 3 times a week because of the addiction possibility. I take one 15 mg capsule. They help me to get a great night's sleep.
2104|2105|Herniated/Bulging Disc dizziness light headedness slight feeligns of euphoria feelings of floating or that of being a lighter weight every few days or so my back pain becomes so severe i cannot get out of bed when i take a soma it usually helps ease the pain enough for me to move around for a few hours you can become addicted to them craving them when you aren t even in pain and eventually you will up your dosage because you can become very tolerant to them you must be careful when taking them for some people they do wonders like myself the key is to know when you actually need them and when you just want to get a buzz from them
2105|2106|Palpitations Hair loss, fatigue, brain fog I have been taking Atenolol for palps (I've had one A-Fib attack 4 years ago). Lately, I've been experiencing palps again. Not sure if Atenolol is working now. But it did completely stop my migraines.
2106|2107|Mood stabilizer, migraines Occasional word loss, drowsiness I love this drug. No headache in four years and it helps stabilize my mood with my bipolar meds. The only weird thing is if I forget a dose I have vivid nightmares, so coming off this med may be hard.
2107|2108|migraine prophlylaxis relief i take it when i feel a migraine coming on and the typical migraine progression either stops entirely or is substantially reduced why treat the headache when this will prevent it
2108|2109|Severe anxiety slight drowsiness but more of a calm relaxed feeling i can credit vistaril for giving me my life back i ve been taking this medication for 4 years and i never want to go without it all the anxiety that once controlled me is gone nervousness is gone no more fear i can t recommend this medication enough it s my godsend honestly it s a miracle i suffered from severe anxiety since i was a child and thanks to vistaril i am myself again
2109|2110|Panic disorder, agoraphobia, PTSD, None This medication literally gave me my life back. After trying so many different ssri's, that only made me gain weight and actually CAUSED depression, I realized that this is the ONLY drug that will let me live a semi normal life, and allow me to leave my house and actually drive on the highway. I am prescribed 1 mg. 3x's a day, but I only take a half mg 3x's a day due my the fear of addiction. Every once in a while I will have to take an extra half mg, depending on the curcumstances. But overall, this medication has been a lifesaver for me.
2110|2111|depression, social anxiety Slight drowsiness. Complete sexual anesthesia Brought me back from severe depression by numbing my emotions (which is what these drugs do, they are emotional anesthetics). That effect is very welcome when one is in midst of a severe depressive crisis. Unfortunately, it destroyed my sexuality, which never recovered upon stopping. It destroyed my self esteem, it ruined my relationships, it made me completely unresponsive to women.
2111|2112|contraceptive; no estrogen none first i d like to start by saying that depo will affect everyone differently and you can never know how it will affect you until you ve tried it if the negative aspects are ones you are not willing to deal with you may not want to try it personally i have had great success with depo and it s hard for me to imagine it can be bad for some people but i know it s possible i have been on depo for 4 5 years now and absolutely love it i feel like it s a miracle drug my periods stopped immediately after the first shot and i only had slight spotting once or twice within six months of the first injection ever since i have been period free and pms free i used to have terrible periods extreme bloating heavy bleeding unbelieveable hunger which lead to weight gain and horrible yeast infections with every period associated with the estrogen levels in my body depo has no estrogen thus no yeast infections for me i have none of that after being on depo and have even lost weig

2121|2122|Depression Was not going to review until I read another reviewer comment...side effects people are posting must be their imagination. Bullcrap!! This drug is DANGEROUS. My side effects ... High blood pressure, reflux, lethargic, blurred vision, short term memory loss and just a feeling of worthless. I decided to stop this drug when I lost my Primary Doctor and was unable to get it filled before I could find a new one. Then the real hell began...withdrawal! I went cold turkey before reading how dangerous that is!! I didn't sleep for a week and when I did the night terrors were terrifying!! Could not eat, nausea,extreme vertigo, brain zaps, mood swings. It took over a month to feel somewhat normal again. I found a support group on Facebook...Cymbalta Hurts Worse, and found out that my side effects were normal and many had it far worse than me. It has been 4 months since I stopped and I still have bouts of short term memory loss, night terrors. I did find my pain has increased (was taking for depression but found out it helped for pain relief) but I'd rather deal with extra pain than take this EVIL DRUG again.
2122|2123|Depression and Chronic Pain Low sex drive. If I miss a dose, I am screwed! It is a double-edged sword for sure! I am currently out of the medicine because I am a Veteran. The VA doesnt respond well if theres a hiccup. I have waiting for 5 days for a refill, I may not make it... Take it off the market yesterday!
2123|2124|Depression, anxiety, chronic pain Low libido, weight gain. I have difficulty swallowing the Australian generic, but no problems w the Cymbalta branded. This medication has saved my life, allows me to be an involved mother, and gives me a significant degree of control over my symptoms. But, as I'm on a high dose, it is imperative that I take my dose at precisely the correct time every 12 hours or I risk paranoia, voices, extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts. These side effects are significantly increased with interactions from other medications.

I have also recently had strange headaches that may or may not be attributed to the Inderal This is a great drug for me and virtually eliminated the physical (outward) signs of nervousness I used to get before presenting to large groups. No more shaking, sweating etc just leaving me to concentrate on delivery. I started on 80mg about 1 hour before needed, but quickly moved up to 2x80mg (taken slightly apart). Perhaps this was unnecessary, but I originally felt one was not enough. Anyway, the ""build up"" dread about a meeting has now gone (this was sometimes 2 weeks BEFORE the presentation!!), and I may only get slightly nervous 10mins before speaking. Once I get going I generally can deliver (what seems to other people) to be a confident, self assured speech. I do worry about the long term side effects though and aim to reduce my dose soon. Not sure what can take Inderals place though..."

2167|2168|Muscle spasms/sleep Dry mouth, lethary in the morning, dizziness. This drug in low doses helps with muscle spasms and the pain associated with this. This will in turn reduce anxiety caused by pain. It also helps the body heal because it is relaxed and resting at night. It is longer acting than other drugs in this same family given for muscle spasms or anxiety associated with pain, such as lorazepam.

2168|2169|Panic Disorder None Xanax stopped my panic attacks in their tracks, especially when dissolved under the tongue. For anxiety management on a day-to-day basis, I felt my dose was not high enough to prevent -all- anxiety, but it was strong enough to keep me from panicking. After taking more than my prescription allowed, I felt calm and euphoric, but unless I wanted to run out of my prescription early this was not something I did often. Occasionally I used it to help me sleep and it worked.

Urinary retention! Sure, took care of the pain, but at too high a cost. I was on an ever increasing dose of this drug (and other opioides)for over five years. I am working with a non-profit orq. to take this medicine OUT of pain management! Too easily abused. To detrimental to G.I tract and Teeth! By the time you notice you have a dental problem it is too late to correct! Already had 22 teeth extracted and the remainder of dental work must be surgically removed. Also WAS on Oxycontin, morphone (switched between two types), Skelaxin, Valium, Neurontin, and many many more! Went to Paihn ReHab.... NOT pain Management.... HUGE DIFFERNCE IN MY LIFE NOW THAT I AM OFF THESE MEDS.... However, NONE affected my body as BADLY as ACTIQ! This drug should ONLY be used in a HOSPICE Environment... NOT... repeat NOT...in pain management for those with Chronic Pain.

2176|2177|PTSD Symptoms After 4 1/2 years on Cymbalta(30mg), and still dealing with Depression from PTSD, I had a 24 hr psychosis event and ended up in the emergency room. My doctor then thought it best to bump my dosage to 60 mg. That extra 30mg of Cymbalta , almost was the last nail in my coffin. Within a few months I was always irritable and angry verbally abusive to my family. My anxiety was on full blast and I couldn't turn it off, causing tremors and restless legs. I slept 3 to 4 days a week, and I had extreme depression. I had migraines and lived in a fog and couldn't even comprehend basic responsibilities , like paying my bills or working my cell phone. I showed paranoia symptoms and my blood pressure would raise or drop at any given moment, I was often dizzy or light headed, probably from the raising and falling of my blood pressure. My heart would beat rapidly much of the time, and my sleep patterns way off. Because many of these symptoms resembled extreme PTSD symptoms and my VA doctor so many mil I am experiencing residue side effect, after a few months without Cymbalta, mostly in tremors and restless legs. Also there is alway an amount of anxiety and nervousness that I never had before, and now rarely goes away.

2184|2185|Major Depressive Dis./Panic Dis. Food aversion, weight loss, nausea, exhaustion, insomnia, brain zaps, cognitive dysfunction, increased depression, paranoia, panic attacks so severe I could not leave my house, memory loss, SEVERE mood swings (crying uncontrollably for no apparent reason to uncontrollable rage that made me want to physically hurt myself &amp; others) Over a period of several years my dose kept going up from 75mg to the max of 300mg and it was effective without too many side effects. When I moved to Florida the Drs here put me on between 75-150mg &amp; my life has been a living hell for the past 10 years!! My recent suicide attempt put me in the care of a Psychiatrist who really researched this &amp; found that some people just cannot be treated at a lower dose once they have taken a higher dose as the Effexor is not only NOT treating the depression but is triggering the brain in severely adverse ways like causing all that uncontrollable rage I mentioned. Like flipping a switch &amp; Id become this absolutely despicable person. Seriously felt like I was possessed by something so truly evil that death was preferable.

2186|2187|Rhumetoid Arthritis the only thing that bothers me about this injection is the pain of the actual injection once i click i don t think i notice any other symptoms apart from weight gain but that is probably just me and not enbrel also the auto injector is so much more convenient because the majority of the syringe ones were always faulty for me and very frustrting i was diagnosed with juvenille chronic arthritis when i was 3 years old since then i have been on almost every other medication for arthritis but nothing worked long term i just remember alway getting sick and being prone to infections and throughout my childhood i pretty much was sore every single day i was depressed as a child because i couldn t really do anything participate in sports go to the shops without using a wheelchair even throughout my schooling i couldn t really cope without a wheelchair and that was lowering my self esteem in 2004 my wonderful doctor introduced enbrel to me and my mother i didn t want it at first mostly because i was scared but he guaranteed that it will work so i gave it a try and it has been the best thing ever for me i honestly rely on this drug so much i noticed a difference as soon as i took it and pretty much can walk now for longer periods i am proud to say that i am 22 years old and i haven t used a wheelchair for quite a few years now i think i am a better and more confident person because of it there are times where i miss my injection which i know is really careless of me and i start to get really bad again but as soon as i have enbrel i am fine again i don t think there is a better alternative out there not for me anyway the auto injector is the way to go

2191|2192|Bipolar II, GAD While going on or changing doses: nights sweats, vivid sometimes disturbing dreams, dry mouth. Lasting side effects: decreased libido, decreased lubrication during sex, inability to achieve orgasm/decreased sensation during orgasm. This medication was a God-send. For a long time, I dealt with no sex life simply because Lexapro, in combination with a mood stabilizer, kept me alive. Recently, it hasn't been working and I've been becoming depressed and suicidal again. Whether my chemicals have changed, or I've become immune to the drug I don't know. I am in the process of switching to a new med.
2192|2193|Acid Reflux None unless I missed a dose. I was told to quit taking this as my magnesium levels had plummeted and I was experiencing chronic pins and needles and muscle cramps. My doctor recommended I stopped taking it straight away and gave me Zantac instead. I am over a month in now and I have to be ridiculously careful about what I eat, even fresh air gives me acid reflux. The only good night's sleep I get is if I throw up before dozing off and I've lost a tonne of weight. Also, haven't had a solid stool in about as long as i was taking the omeprazole.
2193|2194|"Migraines None I've suffered from migraines ever since my hysterectomy in 1987. I've tried everything. I've been on preventative meds and every migraine drug there is. Relpax is the only medicine that has worked for me. It's been like a miracle drug for me. Last year, my neurologist gave me a card from Pfizer that enables me to get my Relpax prescriptions for a $10 co-pay. It's been a life-saver for me. You can use this card whether you have insurance or not. It's called the ""$10 Co-Pay Card."" Call 1-800-422-5604 to get one."
2194|2195|Crohn's tired confusion forgetful saved my life let me have a healthy baby
2195|2196|crohn's during infusion i feel very sleepy and the whole day is basically shot dur to fatigue the nurse said it is from the benadryl that is given before the infusion itching has increased over the years it drives me crazy i am so glad to read that many others have had this problem too many dermatologists and therapists have said there s no reason for the itching and to basically deal with it itching occurs on my arms face hair thighs i ve learned to put anbosol teething gel on the itching spots that helps some this drug has saved my life i have had this disease for 45 years in and out of hospitals with intestinal agony for years in 1994 i finally gave in to having surgery bowel resection after that i could finally eat i was pain free til i got a rectal fistula in 02 that would not heal i had my first remicade treatment dec 02 and the fistula healed within 1 week i ve had infusions every 8 weeks since and i ve had no outbreaks but i think this unusual itching and leg twitching might be side effects getting rid of crohn s symptoms is worth it
2196|2197|ADD, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome none ritalin really helped give me breakthrough the fatigue that was crippling me
2197|2198|"Stage 2b breast cancer At beginning - fatigue, emotional fluctuations, hot flashes, breakthrough vaginal bleeding. After a year, this all calmed down. Am taking a second medication for hot flashes that works wonders! At first, this medication will mess with your hormones (because it suppresses estrogen) and that's why you'll experience a type of menopausal response to it. But now after 6 years, the only ""side effect"" is not having periods anymore and a little bit of hair loss (not enough to worry about). My dr. has been monitoring me and we plan on me staying on it for another 4 years. Gabapentin is what I am taking for hot flashes (300 mg three times a day) and it's working very well for me, since that was the one side effect that really bothered me."
2198|2199|Migraine prophylaxis i sleep more soundly feel more relaxed they ought to put this in the drinking water it virtually eliminated my migraines and i feel more confident
2199|2200|Insomnia/Nightmares/Anxiety none except when i ve run out then i can t sleep and am very irritable nighmares plague me when i do not take this med i take 400 mg at night for sleep i also take neurontin 300 mg twice daily and klonopin 3 mg at night i realize that this is a lot of medication however it has enabled me to combat the effects of bipolar disorder anxiety disorder and ptsd it helps keep me level throughout the whole next day after i take it at bedtime yes the sleep is coma like especially when taken with so much klonopin but that s what i need for me this drug has been a god send i ve recently tried reducing to 300 mg at night but it is causing some mild discomfort though i will continue to attempt to cut down because i d like to take less meds and yes i agree helps with post menapausal symptoms and i haven t had a cold in 6 years as an aside since so many people have mentioned klonopin klonopin works for me much better than xanax but because i ve been on such a high dose for so long my doctor and i both agree that should i want to try and come off of it it would require inpatient management similar to detox
2200|2201|"PTSD Loss of emotion, extremely vivid dreams that made me talk very clearly in my sleep, describing my dream out loud. Severe nausea that progressively got worse the longer I took the drug. Got so bad I was vomiting 3-4 times a day, and could not keep my food down. Quit cold turkey in 2003. I had ""brain zaps"" every 10 minutes or so for the first month. The ""zaps"" got less frequent over time, and after about a year, the zaps were 99% gone, although for about 4 years after stopping Zoloft, I would still get the occasional zap about once every 6-7 months. Have not had any zaps for about 3 years now. I took Zoloft starting in 1997 and was on 150 mg./day until April, 2006 when I quit cold-turkey. I tried other antidepressants to no avail, so I tried Zoloft again last year, but could only take 5 months of it before the nausea got too bad to bear anymore."
2201|2202|ADHD (Adult) just the normal appetite loss but well welcomed and the normal adderall side effects nothing unpleasant this has been a merical drug for me ive been on it for almost 7 yrs now there is a pretty quick tolerance build up
2202|2203|DDD, Cervical Radiculopathy, etc. 4 surface cavities plus 11 teeth with no enamel at the gumline (high risk for future cavities). These were my first cavities ever. I brush my teeth 3x/day &amp; that's probably why I went 6 years with no problems, but now my teeth are a mess. It is not just the sugar, but also the citric acid in Actiq that supposedly contributed to them. I always put the medication on one side of my mouth -- that's where all the cavities were &amp; most of the teeth with the stripped enamel. Works great for pain. Fentanyl is the only narcotic I'm not allergic to. Tried Duragesic, but even the lowest dose available caused an overdose. No other side effects besides the tooth decay. I've gone off it for a month or so at a time to manage tolerance &amp; didn't have any issues.
2203|2204|ADD weight loss it s an amazing drug i went from failing the 6th grade 4th semester when i first started on it to getting a s in all my classes the last semester there s a huge difference between when i do and don t use it i m more motivated to do things when i ve taken it even things like cleaning my room i don t need to be told to do add drugs are fickle though so what works for one person may not for another doesn t mean you should give up though if this one fails there are others out there the dose did have to be increased as i got older because naturally i grew so the same dose had a lesser effect on my 18 year old body as it had on my 12 year old one d
2204|2205|autoimmune urticaria drowsiness very recently splitting headache and nausea 3 days after withdrawal i started with 25 mg tab 1 day 7 years ago for autoimmune urticaria after 2 months the hives were managed and the itch was less over the years i started to taper the dose from 1 tab to 1 2 tab until 1 4 tab as prescribed by the doctor and ive been on the 1 4 tab dose for 3 years and the hives almost never appeared 3 days ago i stopped taking it to check whether hives would appear now on the 3rd day im not sure whether this splitting headache and nausea are withdrawal symptoms anyone experienced the same
2205|2206|Major depression Weight gain and fluctuation The drug works well. It does slow metabolism. You initially lose some weight.. Then if you don't watch food intake and carbs... You will gain weight over a period of years. It also fluctuates up or down even if you hardly eat but eat starch and do not sweat or excersise moderately. The long term effects, if you do not maintain a low food intake and SOME excersise will most often cause a gain of 3 to 10 pounds
2206|2207|hypothyroidism my doctor added cytomel to my synthroid since my tsh levels and t3 and t4 were all inconsistent had significant fatigue dramatic weight gain 15 lbs in one month and puffy neck and face cytomel has made a huge difference i can focus and have clarity all day i have lost all the weight that i gained and my blood tests are all within normal range this t3 supplement did the trick and was able to decrease dosage of synthroid my doc has me take the synthroid at bed time and the cytomel first thing in the morning to aleviate false high tsh levels i have the best doc in world

No help in stabilizing mood. Tapering down 2-5 mg every 2-3 months for two years now. Be very careful tapering down - life feels very futile for a few days so surround yourself with lot's of comfort and safety. it takes several weeks to normalize when I go down 5 mg. I'm at 20 mg/day now and hope to be done by the end of 2016.

It has kept me from being hospitalized several times. I've taken it for about a month straight before and didn't have a hard time coming off it. I know that it can be addictive and has the risk of being abused but if used correctly for someone with panic attacks it is a life saver.
2252|2253|depression, anxiety and insomnia Very few side effects. Some vivid dreams at first and some difficulty achieving orgasm. Update: After being on 50mg for 8 years, I realized that over the last year or so I drifted back into depression. Went to doc. Upped the dosage to 150mg and I feel wonderful. Anxiety, panic and depression and general apathy is gone. I avoided talking to people and didn't want to leave the house. This happened so slowly and gradually I didn't even notice. Now that I'm back to normal, thanks to zoloft I can see how bad I was. It has literally given me my life back. Give these meds time to work. Start slowly and give them time.

Extreme fatigue, brain fog, nightmares, etc. The worse drug I've EVER taken!! Before you even consider taking Cymbalta, you NEED to have an in depth conversation w/your Dr about what happens if you need to stop taking this med. It is a nightmare to discontinue &amp; I spent over a year w/what is called ""Cymbalta withdrawal syndrome. Yes, it truly does exist &amp; I can tell you from my heart it was the worse med I've ever tried to come off of my life! Literally opening up the capsules to count the individual beads so I wouldn't go through worse withdrawals. Brain zaps, migraines, nausea, severe stomach aches, body aches &amp; pains, horrible nightmares, &amp; excessive sweating. My new Dr states he believes this med should be taken off of the market! Eli Lilly LIED on the inserts stating only 1-2% had Cymbalta Withdrawal Syndrome, when actually over 50% did. Check out the number of Cymbalta court cases that are now being filed if you don't believe me. I even called Eli Lilly-yes I was completely manic after 2mos of withdrawal, &amp; asked them what I should do about what I was going through. They stated I needed to get stomach meds, anxiety meds, &amp; to see my Dr for other meds to treat the withdrawal symptoms. I asked if any funding was available for see a psychiatrist &amp;/or paying for the additional meds? ""No, but I will relay your ideas to my superiors"". Eli Lilly contacted my Dr, without telling me, stating I was suicidal, &amp; many other other things. This forced my Dr to fill out mandatory forms &amp; continue constant appoin"

I take it at the first sign of a headache as needed. It's 325,g acetaminophen/40mg of caffeine &amp; I think 50mg of a barbiturate. Sometimes I have to take a second pill when the first one wears off but it keeps me from getting a severe headache most of the time. If I wait too long to take it it might not work as good and a 2nd or 3rd pill might be needed later in the day. Usually takes me a month or two to go through a 30 day supply but since it's allergy season and lots of rain been taking it almost every day lately, it helps a great deal. I don't travel anywhere without it just in case.

Do not miss a dose--take every day or else you will have a huge withdrawl hangover. This medication saved my life. I started this medication in 2006 soon after being diagnosed with Bipolar NOS, also carrying in-tow a crippling self-injury addiction. I was not stable, my mood swings were uncontrollable, razors controlled my life, and I am still so thankful I didn't kill myself before finding help. I spend around 3-4 months trying medication after medication to stabalize me, but absolultly nothing was working. I was finally put on this medication (i did not get a rash even though I went straight up to a high dose), and it was immediately like night-and-day for me. I suddenly wasn't a slave to my emotional state, and my thoughts became more clear instead of being muffled. This medication gave me clarity when I had absolutely none. Of course, medication cannot cure addictions or change the way you think, but lamotrigine (I take the generic) gave me the stability I needed to start the process of quitting and the mental sharpness to see logic and sanilty when I was considering cutting. Otherwise, the craving just consumed everything. After only being on this medication for maybe 4-6 months and was put on 30mg abilify to 'seal the deal' if you will, I had cut down from cutting 2-4 times every single day to cutting once every 2-3 weeks. That was a huge deal for a stressed out, self-conscious high schooler like me. At around the 8th year, I had a huge mental illness/SI relapse while in college. I went to my psychaitrist regarding this and was put on a medium

2292|2293|For depression Positive side effects only: some slimming, some rise in libido. At this dose I did not follow an MAO diet and had no problems. (All on doctor's advice.) It works for depression for me. It has been by far the best thing I have found in over 30 years of trying a great many things. . DOWN SIDE - the different pill formulations are NOT the same - no capsule form has worked for me, which I had to discover via laborious trial and error, and I believe there has been a recent change in the tablet as the effect diminished with the last refill -- I am somewhat more depressed - and there is also a negative change in the texture of my hair, which has become wispy. (A similar thing happened to me years ago when I took Wellbutrin.) I am unhappy with this change, and imagine it affects patients taking the medicine for other reasons too. I think that the original makers of the med stopped making it in factor of making/selling Emsam patches, which are much more expensive.

I had previously been on Levlen ED for 6 months or so, and had put on a fair amount of weight and fluid. I lost the weight within 6 months, and didn't have any issues with it. It was only a few years ago, I noticed my sleeping issues and panic attacks. Not once, did I think it was the pill. So I kept taking it, and recently I decided I wanted to try and concieve. I went off the pill, and I've been having all kinds of horrible side effects. Hair loss is a big one, my poor hair is shedding like crazy. It is oily and my skin is oily, too. I've only been off yasmin for 3 months and I've been having dizzy spells. I'd recommend against taking Yasmin!

2320|2321|Migraine I had no side effects when I first started taking Relpax. At that time, I needed it so much! Now, whenever I take one as I need them less frequently, I get sick to my stomach. It relieves my migraine pain tho, so that is what is important for me!! This is the only medicine that has EVER helped me..and I have tried pretty much all migraine meds over the years.. I believe it has been around 13 years on this medication..I cannot remember exactly when I started taking it tho as it has been awhile. Also, I must always have some of this on hand as it is the only thing that works for my migraines. With that being said, 6 pills at $256 is so much money!! We recently changed insurance plans and this is how much I have to pay. Tho, on my previous insurance it was only $10 with the Relpax savings card! It's crazy how it can be so expensive with one plan over another.

Bare in mind, I took the lowest dose of xanax and still got ""tolerance"" addiction!!!!! one pill a day, yep. Withdrawal was HELL. Read Benzo.org, Prof Ashton's info on benzo's.

2331|2332|Tension headache &amp; facial/tmj pain Occasionally experience respiratory depression when taken before bed; will wake up gasping for air shortly after falling asleep. This medication has worked really well for me for many years, to the point where I previously would have rated it at a 5. Was the only thing to help control my severe pain with minimal side effects. But the new capsule formulation isn't nearly as effective as the old tablets, for reasons I don't understand. The only differences are 25 mg less acetaminophen and now in a gelatin capsule vs the old tablet form, so it doesn't make any logical sense - but I am consistently feeling as if I have taken a placebo with this new capsule. It seems to have no effect on me at all. Maybe the gelatin capsule isn't breaking down as it's supposed to in my stomach? Am considering asking a compounding pharmacist to prepare it for me in a different type of capsule to see if that makes a difference. Will update when/if I am able to try this.

I actually took MS Contin and it made me deathly sick. I had to stop taking them and was introduced to Kadian as a substitute. I worked for awhile and then I had to increase the strength several times until I got to 80mg. He then put me on Lyrica 150mg twice daily to help the nerve pain in my left leg. Along with Celebrex 200mg and Zoloft for depressiion and pain, I don't hurt too bad. I feel spaced out most of the time and I have been taking these drugs for about 15 years.

2340|2341|Neurological symptoms None whatsoever. Post quadruple by-pass I suffered chronically from what is best described as electrical discharges in my brain. This was also accompanied by loss of confidence at driving, of heights, and in general. I also suffered numerous mini-blackouts. Selegiline effectively controls those symptoms but regretfully does not appear to cure the problem. There appears to be a connection between my heart and my brain (obviously) and I suspect those neurological symptoms could be due to minor heart-attacks which this drug effectively controls. I discovered those benefits through reading the literature and had to battle with the GP/MD to have them prescribed rather than having to purchase from the Internet.

I tend to get anxiety and OCD if going through a big stressor in life or in the winter time due to seasonal affective disorder.

The way I finally got to 37.5 mgs pills was due to pregnancy. In my 3rd trimester I just said ""enough"" and this is the lowest dose I have been on and been able to maintain-2 years now.

All from Dizziness, Drinking an absurd amount of water, depressed, sleepy, insomnia, animia ( required bloodtransfusion) and lots more , maybe more allergic ( got 2 anaphylactic shocks within a month) 2 months ago I got really bad breathing trouble , it is like I can not get the air all the way down to my lungs. My lungs and heart got checked but there was nothing wrong, other than I suffer from a low puls from time to time. The doctors then made the conclusion that it is because of my back, The doctor gave me Tramadol for my back pain and then it got really scary after 3 pills (not at once) I got an anaphylactic shock and was taken to the hospital. A month after this I took some bricanyl inhaler because I was so frustrated with my trouble of breathing properly. I have taken this medicine before and I did not have any problem with this medicine. This time I got my second anaphylactic shock. After 2 anaphylactic shock I was so scared to take my medicine, so 7 days ago I stopped taken my Omeprazole. First thing I noticed I now drink water like a normal person. But I am so dizzy that I am afraid to pass out. I have lots of panic attacks and overall feel like my muscles does not work properly and I have been sweating/cold sweating like crazy. But on the positive side my breathing is almost back to normal. Can any of you tell me how long I will feel like crap, with dizziness and panic attack and sweating and breathing trouble ? Can someone please me help , I have not taken them for 7 days now , but today my breathing is not good again. Can someone reassure ? Plz mail me.

I didn't realize this caused dehydration - until I saw reviews - which I've had almost as long as I've taken this drug. I worried it might be diabetes, which tests always came up negative. My doctor never suggested it was the Inderal. Hmm. The other side effect is impotence, total lack of interest, which really didn't start until my early 50's. It definitely helped my migraines, which were severe. The last 10 years, I've only had 2 when I missed a dose of Inderal.
